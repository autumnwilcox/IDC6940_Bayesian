    "text": "Bayesian parametric models for survival prediction in medical applications\nIwan Paolucci, Yuan-Mao Lin, Jessica Albuquerque Marques Silva, Kristy K. Brock & Bruno C. Odisio\nBMC Medical Research Methodology volume 23, Article number: 250 (2023)\nThis research article, published in BMC Medical Research Methodology, introduces and evaluates Bayesian parametric survival models for predicting patient outcomes in medical applications. The authors, Paolucci et al., highlight the advantages of Bayesian models, such as their ability to provide uncertainty measures, require less hyperparameter tuning, and offer a natural mechanism for model updating using Bayes’ rule without needing original training data due to privacy concerns. The study compares these Bayesian models against conventional survival prediction methods like Cox Proportional Hazards and Random Survival Forests, demonstrating comparable performance while exhibiting less overfitting. The article details the mathematical background of these models, their implementation, and presents results from experiments on various public medical datasets to support their utility in personalized medicine.\n\nProblem\nSurvival analysis is crucial in medical research for predicting patient outcomes, such as time until death or disease recurrence. Traditional models like Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) and Random Survival Forests (RSF) have limitations, including assumptions about hazard ratios and challenges with interpretability. Bayesian parametric models offer a promising alternative by providing uncertainty measures, requiring less hyperparameter tuning, and allowing for model updates without needing original training data, which is beneficial for privacy concerns.\nA major gap in current predictive models for medical applications is the lack of a measure of uncertainty associated with predictions, which is crucial for physicians making high-stakes clinical decisions, especially when treatments have differing side effect profiles or costs.\nThe study tackles practical and technical challenges inherent in medical machine learning. Medical datasets are often limited in size due to the subclassification of diseases, making models highly prone to overfitting. Many existing machine learning algorithms also require extensive hyperparameter tuning to implement regularization and prevent this overfitting.\n\n\nMethodology\nThe authors introduce Bayesian parametric survival models, which are based on the assumption that survival times follow a specific statistical distribution (e.g., Exponential, Weibull, Lognormal). These models use Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of the chosen distribution, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge and the quantification of uncertainty in predictions.\n\nBayesian Parametric Survival Models (BPS)\n\nImplemented using the PyMC library in Python.\nModels include Exponential and Weibull distributions.\nParameters are estimated using Linear combinations and neural networks to predict the parameters of the distributions.\n\nTraining\n\nPyMC framework\nBayes Rule for updating (posterior as prior)\n\nEvaluation\n\nPublic Datasets: AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), German Breast Cancer Study (GBCS), Veteran lung cancer (Veteran), Worcester Heart Attack Study (WHAS), and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)\nExperiment 1: Comparison of Bayesian models with CoxPH, RSF, and DeepSurv\nExperiment 2: Model updating vs retraining from scratch\nExperiment 3: Impact of dataset size on model performance\nMetrics: Concordance Index (C-index), Integrated Brier Score (IBS)\nComparison with Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forests, and DeepSurv\n\n\n\n\nResults\nThe results demonstrate that Bayesian parametric survival models perform comparably to traditional methods like CoxPH and RSF, with some advantages in terms of reduced overfitting and the ability to provide uncertainty estimates. The models also showed robustness when updating with new data, maintaining performance without needing to retrain from scratch.\n\nPerformance comparison\n\nBPS models performed well, no consistent best model\nBPS Wb NN superior for PBC dataset\n\nOverfitting\n\nBPS and CoxPH & Weibull based models overfit least\nDeepSurv & RSF showed more overfitting\n\nUncertainty estimation beneficial for clinical decision-making\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nBPS models are competitive, robust, and well-suited for medical applications.\nKey advantages: less overfitting, uncertainty quantification, reduced hyperparameter tuning.\nEfficient model updating without original data (preserves privacy).\nLimitations: datasets used in the study are relatively small, computation time not compared."

    "text": "What is BART-Survival?\n\nIt’s a Python software package developed by the CDC.\nThe package is for survival analysis: studying time-to-event data (how long until something happens, or doesn’t happen).\nIt uses a machine learning method called Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART).\n\nHow does it work (in simple terms)? - “Discrete-time” means it splits up time into chunks (for example, weeks, months, etc.). The model checks at each time‐point whether the event has happened yet or not. - BART is “non-parametric”, which means the model doesn’t assume a fixed mathematical form (like linear or exponential) for how risk changes over time. It lets the data itself shape the risk patterns more flexibly. - Because it’s Bayesian, it gives not just a prediction but also measures of uncertainty (how confident the model is) about those predictions.\nWhat makes it useful / better in some cases - Traditional survival analysis (like the Cox model) often assumes certain things (e.g. that hazards are proportional over time). If those assumptions are wrong, the models can be misleading. BART-Survival is more flexible and can perform better when assumptions of older methods fail. - It provides a friendly API, and tools to dive deeper into the model (e.g. inspecting results, uncertainty) when needed.\nWhen / where we might use it - When you have data about when events happen (or don’t happen) and want to model that. For example, time until recovery, time until equipment failure, time until some event in public health etc. - When you suspect that the standard assumptions of simpler survival models may not hold (e.g. that risk doesn’t change proportionally over time). - When you want flexible models that can give you both predictions and uncertainty.\n\nReference\n\nSparapani, R.

Electronic health records (EHRs) could improve diagnostic accuracy and predict treatment effects. Visualizations of characteristics of posterior distributions can be immediately understood by clinicians and patients as relevant to their decision. Combining prior knowledge and patient data with evidence could predict the patient’s health status, trajectory, and/or likely benefits of interventions.\nHow is it solved?\nMethod: The authors applied Bayesian hierarchical regression for multivariate longitudinal patient data using open-source R-packages and developed 2 levels—time within person and persons within a population\nThe model combined exogenous (eg, age, clinical history) factors and endogenous (eg, current treatment) variables on the individual’s multivariate health measurements and the effects of health measurements at one time on subsequent interventions.\nThe model produced an estimate of the posterior distribution for each value of the predictor variable and an estimate of the marginal distribution of the regression coefficients for each coefficient that measures the outcome (health status) associated with its predictor variables. In a larger sample, the likelihood dominates the prior distribution for regression coefficients and Bayesian hierarchical model used a likelihood-based approach, used priors (prior laboratory and clinical trials data) that provided the assay sensitivities, which through the prior assumptions, made the model identifiable and the integration of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates the posterior distributions, avoided missing data and complex outcome measurements.\nResults\nThree case studies: pneumonia etiology in children, prostate cancer, and mental disorders chosen for model development, identified low-risk patient population, reduced the risk of overtreatment, complications, adverse effects, and financial burden for patients (Disease Reclassification).

The probability distributions associated with quantitative diagnostic test outcomes often demonstrate some overlap between the diseased and nondiseased groups. The dichotomous method fails to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of disease presentations across diverse populations. The applicability of the normal distribution (conventional method) is critiqued, especially in dealing with clinical measurands having skewness, bimodality, or multimodality.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: The Authors developed models employing Bayesian inference (Bayesian diagnostic approach) to calculate the posterior probability of disease diagnosis in the Wolfram Language and integrated prior probabilities of disease with distributions of diagnostic measurands in both diseased and nondiseased populations. The approach enabled the evaluation of combined data from multiple diagnostic tests and improved the diagnostic accuracy, precision and adaptability, The model showed flexibility, adaptability, and versatility in the diagnostic.\nResults\nNonparametric Bayesian models tend to fit data distributions better, especially given limited existing literature, and are more robust in capturing complex data patterns.\nThese models produce multimodal probability patterns for disease, unlike the bimodal, double-sigmoidal curves seen with parametric models.\nLimitations\n\nReliance on parametric models: A need to extend to nonparametric or more flexible parametric models for medical data.\nLimited scholarly publications and over-dependence on prior probabilities increase uncertainties, resulting in broader confidence intervals for posterior probabilities. Systemic bias (unrepresentative datasets) compromises the accuracy of Bayesian calculations. For Incomplete datasets, Bayesian methods combined with other statistical and computational techniques could enhance diagnostic capabilities.\nThe foundational data is crucial to compare new diagnostic measurements. Absence of normative data compromises the reliability and validity of Bayesian diagnostic methods. @Chatzimichail2023\n\n\nBayesian model stages, development and advantages, and temporal models\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\n\nThe study describes the stages of Bayesian analysis, specifying the importance of the priors, data modeling, inferences, model checking and refinement, selecting a proper sampling technique from a posterior distribution, variational inferences, variable selection and its application across various research fields. The study proposes strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist and outlining the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence in the future.\nWhy is it important?\nBayesian statistics is suitable for quantitative researchers accross different fields who have at least some knowledge of regression modelling.\nHow is it solved?\nExamples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields (social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine) and the advantages and disadvantages of the Bayesian model are provided here, and overview of the current and future use of Bayesian statistics.\nThe study mention priors into three categories (informative, weakly informative and diffuse) based on the degree of (un)certainty (hyperparameters) surrounding the population parameter. The prior distribution is as - N( μ0 , σ^ 20) where a larger variance represents a greater amount of uncertainty surrounding.\nPrior elicitation (experts, generic expert, data-based, sample data using maximum likelihood or sample statistics, etc) construct a prior distribution.\nPrior sensitivity analysis of the likelihood helps examine different forms of the model, assesses how the priors and the likelihood align and have an impact on posterior estimates, reflecting variations not captured by the prior or the likelihood alone.\nPrior estimation allows data-informed shrinkage, enacts regularization or influence algorithms towards a likely high-density region, and improves estimation efficiency.\nKnowing the exact probabilistic specification of the priors for a complex model with smaller sample sizes is important. A small sample conveys less information compared to the priors that quantify the strength of support the observed data lends to possible value(s) for the unknown parameter(s).\nFrequentists do not consider the probability of the unknown parameters as useful, and they are considered to be fixed; the likelihood is the conditional probability distribution p(y|θ) of the data (y), given fixed parameters (θ). In Bayesian inference, unknown parameters (random variables) have varied values, while the (observed) data have fixed values, and the likelihood is a function of θ for the fixed data y.\nTherefore, the likelihood function summarizes a statistical model that stochastically generates a range of possible values for θ and the observed data y. With priors and the likelihood of the observed data, the resulting posterior distribution provides an estimate of the unknown parameters, capturing the primary factors and improving our understanding. Monte Carlo technique provides integrals of sampled values from a given distribution through computer simulations. The packages BRMS and Blavaan in R are used for the probabilistic programming language Stan.\nVariable selection after checking correlations among the variables in the model (Eg: gene-to-gene interaction) aids in the prediction of genes in biomedical research (genome-wide association studies).\nSpatial and temporal variability are factored in Bayesian general linear models. A posterior distribution can simulate new data conditional on this distribution, assess, and provide valid predictions to be used for extrapolating to future events.\nResults\nThe Bayesian approach analyzes large-scale cancer genomic data, identifies novel molecular changes in cancer initiation and progression, the interactions between mutated genes and captured mutational signatures, highlighting key genetic interactions components, allowing genomic-based patient stratification both in clinical trials, in the personalized use of therapeutics, and in understanding cancer and its evolutionary processes.\nLimitations:\n\nIn temporal models, posterior inference challenges are inherent in the spatial and/or temporal dependencies (autocorrelation of parameters over time). @VandeSchoot2021\n\n\nBayesian Normal linear regression\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe author provides guidance on Bayesian inference by performing Bayesian Normal linear regression in metrology to calibrate instruments and to evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons in determining fundamental constants.\nWhy is it important?\nThe measurement errors are assumed to be additive, independent, and identically distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance σ2, which is usually unknown.\nRegression is used to calibrate instruments, evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons, or determine fundamental constants, but the regression model cannot be uniquely formulated as a measurement function. Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements are not applicable directly.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: Bayesian inference has the advantage of accounting for additional a priori information, which robustifies the analyses.\nThree steps (prior elicitation, posterior calculation, and robustness to prior uncertainty and model adequacy) and model assumptions are critical to Bayesian inference.\nIn Bayesian inference, all unknowns—observables (data) as well as unobservables (parameters and auxiliary variables) are considered to be random, are assigned probability distributions to summarize the available information, and to update prior knowledge about the unobservables with information about them contained in the data. The prior distribution and likelihood function provided by simple graphical displays, sensitivity analyses, or model checking enhance the elicitation and interpretation process.\nFor Normal linear regression problems\n(1) a family of prior distributions for θ and σ2 is (Normal inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution to a posterior from the same family of (NIG) distributions or\n(2) alternative families of prior distributions (hierarchical priors) assign an additional layer of distributions to uncertain prior parameters or non-para- metric priors.\nThe NIG prior with known variance σ2 of observations is a conjugate prior distribution. Vague or non-informative prior distributions can be derived from the NIG prior.\nBayesian inference is influenced by\n\nthe uncertainty in the transformation of prior knowledge to prior distributions\nthe assumptions of the statistical model\nthe mistakes in data acquisition\n\nResults\nThe knowledge from related previous experiments (Normal inverse Gamma distributions) allow for analytic posterior calculations of many quantities of interest. @Klauenberg2015\n\nBayesian linear regression and priors (exchangeable and unexchangeable)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe study developed a test of a formal method for augmenting data in linear regression analyses, by incorporating both exchangeable and unexchangeable information on regression coefficients (and standard errors) of previous studies.\nWhy is it important?\nThe frequent combination of multiple testing has relatively low statistical power, which is problematic in null-hypothesis significance testing. Linear regression analyses do not account for the published results and summary statistics from similar previous studies. Ignoring information on parameters from previous studies (relevant and readily available), affects the stability and precision of the parameter estimates and results in lower values than they could have been, resulting in conclusions that are less certain and are affected by sampling variation.\nMultiple linear regression with separate significance tests for all regression coefficients, and with the modest sample sizes, different studies find different sets of statistically significant predictors, and addressing the issue on larger samples is practically unrealistic.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: Bayesian linear regression accommodates prior knowledge, overcoming the absence of formal studies, handles the issues of increasing the sample size, and augments the data of a new study with previous results (regression coefficients and standard errors) from similar studies.\nThe authors used Bayesian linear regression to solve the issue of the univariate case analysis by combining evidence of specific predictors from different linear regression analyses (as in meta-analysis) and found it a better method to resolve the issue of simultaneously combining multiple regression parameters per study, which ignored the relationship between the regression coefficients. Includes summary statistics from previous studies, Bayesian linear regression provided a more acceptable solution when data from previous studies were not (realistically) obtainable.\nModels in the study as categorized the model into - (1) Exchangable - when the current data and previous studies have the same set of predictors. (2) Unexchangable – when the predictors were different in the two.\nTo yield the posterior density that reflects the updated knowledge about the model parameters after having observed the data, the steps to Bayesian linear regression steps are mentioned -\n(1) To calculate the probability density function for the data given the unknown model parameters;\n(2) Taken as a function of those model parameters, the likelihood function is the second part of the prior density function of the model parameters. It quantifies what is assumed to be known about the model parameters before observing the data. The study applied the Standard multiple linear regression model, and with the integration of the prior, provided the joint posterior density using the Gibbs sampler. An Ordinary Least Squares linear regression was then applied to each of these samples to obtain the estimated regression coefficients B and the corresponding standard errors.\n(3) A hierarchical model version was developed in analyzing parameters where studies are not exchangeable.\nResults\nIncorporating priors from previous studies in a linear regression on new data yielded a significantly better parameter estimate with an adequate approximation.\nThe gains in comparison to using just the new data, and the large effects were obtained when the data from previous studies were available, resulting in encouraging performance.\nPerformance of the two versions (exchangeable and unexchangeable) of the replication model was consistently superior to using current data alone.\nThe model developed in the article offers the possibility of obtaining significantly better parameter estimates in a linear regression setting without needing to expend a prohibitive amount of time and energy to obtain data from the previous studies.\nHierarchical version (unexchangeable) of the model offers the advantage of being able to address questions about differences between studies and thus allows for explicit testing of the exchangeability assumption.\nLimitations:\n\nAll studies need to have the same set of predictors.\nThe issue of predictor variables that are correlated. @DeLeeuw2012a\n\n\nBayesian logistic regression (Sequential clinical reasoning approach)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe study aimed to develop models using a longitudinal prospective cohort to predict the risk of incident cardiovascular disease by incorporating demographic features (basic), six metabolic syndrome components (metabolic score), and conventional risk factors (enhanced model). The study participants free of CVD at baseline were followed up over five years, and a Bayesian clinical reasoning model was applied to diagnose new CVD cases.\nWhy is it important?\nEarly diagnosis, prevention, by identifying subjects under the high-risk category for cardiovascular disease (CVD), impacts health interventions.\nLimited availability of molecular information in clinical practice due to being costly and unavailability affects efficient disease diagnosis. To efficiently identify a high-risk population based on the routinely checked biological markers before doing these expensive molecular testsThe requires an alternative approach to analyze data.\nThe Tailored Framingham Risk Score method, for the purpose, is not sufficient because of the differences present in ethnic groups, location, and socio-economic status, as they require the construction of their own models. Heterogeneity (geographic, ethnic group, variations, and different characteristics of social contextual network) often is unobservable and unmeasurable.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: The study evaluated subjects enrolled in a Keelung Community-based Integrated Screening (KCIS) Program, for mass screening (20–79 years) in the Keelung city of Taiwan, who were followed for 5 years to identify incident cancers and chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease).\nThe study classified the risk of having incident CVD cases or death from CVD by dint of available calculated standardized risk score of the MetS components (fasting glucose, blood pressure, HDL-C, triglyceride and waist circumference) together with conventional risk factors (gender, heredity, smoking, alcohol drinking, family history of parent’s CVD and betel quid and other relevant factors).\nEmulating a clinician’s evaluation process, the Bayesian clinical reasoning approach in a sequential manner was applied and three models were developed. The approach considered the normal distribution of regression coefficients of all predictors, allowing for uncertainty of clinical weights. The credible intervals of predicted risk estimates were obtained by averaging out. In the model, the individual risk is elicited by prior speculation (first impression) that is updated by objective observed data (patient’s history and laboratory findings), the regression coefficients for computing risk score were treated as random variable with a certain statistical distribution (e.g. normal distribution) rather than a fixed value (traditional risk prediction model by frequentist). The updated prior distribution with the likelihood of the current data provided a posterior distribution to predict the risk for a specific disease. The sequential approach included -\n\nThe (basic) basic model developed via logistic regression used prior information constructed on gender, age, age2, and time period.\nThe second (classical) model (metabolic score model: MS model) was based on six MetS components.\nThe third (enhanced model) incorporated information on smoking, drinking, betel-quid, and family history of CVD.\n\nResults\nCompared to the basic model and classical model, the enhanced model had better performance. The proposed models predicted CVD incidence at the individual level by incorporating routine information with a sequential Bayesian clinical reasoning approach. Patients’ background significantly contributes to baseline risk. Even with ecological heterogeneity, the regression model adopts individual characteristics and makes individual risk prediction for the CVD incidence.\nLimitations:\n\nWhether the interactions between age, gender, metabolic score, and other risk factors should be included.\nThe use of an enhanced model should be validated through external validation by applying the proposed models to new subjects not included in the training of the model parameters. @Liu2013"

The approach enabled the evaluation of combined data from multiple diagnostic tests and improved the diagnostic accuracy, precision and adaptability, The model showed flexibility, adaptability, and versatility in the diagnostic.\nResults\nNonparametric Bayesian models tend to fit data distributions better, especially given limited existing literature, and are more robust in capturing complex data patterns.\nThese models produce multimodal probability patterns for disease, unlike the bimodal, double-sigmoidal curves seen with parametric models.\nLimitations\n\nReliance on parametric models: A need to extend to nonparametric or more flexible parametric models for medical data.\nLimited scholarly publications and over-dependence on prior probabilities increase uncertainties, resulting in broader confidence intervals for posterior probabilities. Systemic bias (unrepresentative datasets) compromises the accuracy of Bayesian calculations. For Incomplete datasets, Bayesian methods combined with other statistical and computational techniques could enhance diagnostic capabilities.\nThe foundational data is crucial to compare new diagnostic measurements. Absence of normative data compromises the reliability and validity of Bayesian diagnostic methods. @Chatzimichail2023\n\n\nBayesian model stages, development and advantages, and temporal models\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\n\nThe study describes the stages of Bayesian analysis, specifying the importance of the priors, data modeling, inferences, model checking and refinement, selecting a proper sampling technique from a posterior distribution, variational inferences, variable selection and its application across various research fields. The study proposes strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist and outlining the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence in the future.\nWhy is it important?\nBayesian statistics is suitable for quantitative researchers accross different fields who have at least some knowledge of regression modelling.\nHow is it solved?\nExamples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields (social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine) and the advantages and disadvantages of the Bayesian model are provided here, and overview of the current and future use of Bayesian statistics.\nThe study mention priors into three categories (informative, weakly informative and diffuse) based on the degree of (un)certainty (hyperparameters) surrounding the population parameter. The prior distribution is as - N( μ0 , σ^ 20) where a larger variance represents a greater amount of uncertainty surrounding.\nPrior elicitation (experts, generic expert, data-based, sample data using maximum likelihood or sample statistics, etc) construct a prior distribution.\nPrior sensitivity analysis of the likelihood helps examine different forms of the model, assesses how the priors and the likelihood align and have an impact on posterior estimates, reflecting variations not captured by the prior or the likelihood alone.\nPrior estimation allows data-informed shrinkage, enacts regularization or influence algorithms towards a likely high-density region, and improves estimation efficiency.\nKnowing the exact probabilistic specification of the priors for a complex model with smaller sample sizes is important. A small sample conveys less information compared to the priors that quantify the strength of support the observed data lends to possible value(s) for the unknown parameter(s).\nFrequentists do not consider the probability of the unknown parameters as useful, and they are considered to be fixed; the likelihood is the conditional probability distribution p(y|θ) of the data (y), given fixed parameters (θ). In Bayesian inference, unknown parameters (random variables) have varied values, while the (observed) data have fixed values, and the likelihood is a function of θ for the fixed data y.\nTherefore, the likelihood function summarizes a statistical model that stochastically generates a range of possible values for θ and the observed data y. With priors and the likelihood of the observed data, the resulting posterior distribution provides an estimate of the unknown parameters, capturing the primary factors and improving our understanding. Monte Carlo technique provides integrals of sampled values from a given distribution through computer simulations. The packages BRMS and Blavaan in R are used for the probabilistic programming language Stan.\nVariable selection after checking correlations among the variables in the model (Eg: gene-to-gene interaction) aids in the prediction of genes in biomedical research (genome-wide association studies).\nSpatial and temporal variability are factored in Bayesian general linear models. A posterior distribution can simulate new data conditional on this distribution, assess, and provide valid predictions to be used for extrapolating to future events.\nResults\nThe Bayesian approach analyzes large-scale cancer genomic data, identifies novel molecular changes in cancer initiation and progression, the interactions between mutated genes and captured mutational signatures, highlighting key genetic interactions components, allowing genomic-based patient stratification both in clinical trials, in the personalized use of therapeutics, and in understanding cancer and its evolutionary processes.\nLimitations:\n\nIn temporal models, posterior inference challenges are inherent in the spatial and/or temporal dependencies (autocorrelation of parameters over time). @VandeSchoot2021\n\n\nBayesian Normal linear regression\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe author provides guidance on Bayesian inference by performing Bayesian Normal linear regression in metrology to calibrate instruments and to evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons in determining fundamental constants.\nWhy is it important?\nThe measurement errors are assumed to be additive, independent, and identically distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance σ2, which is usually unknown.\nRegression is used to calibrate instruments, evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons, or determine fundamental constants, but the regression model cannot be uniquely formulated as a measurement function. Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements are not applicable directly.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: Bayesian inference has the advantage of accounting for additional a priori information, which robustifies the analyses.\nThree steps (prior elicitation, posterior calculation, and robustness to prior uncertainty and model adequacy) and model assumptions are critical to Bayesian inference.\nIn Bayesian inference, all unknowns—observables (data) as well as unobservables (parameters and auxiliary variables) are considered to be random, are assigned probability distributions to summarize the available information, and to update prior knowledge about the unobservables with information about them contained in the data. The prior distribution and likelihood function provided by simple graphical displays, sensitivity analyses, or model checking enhance the elicitation and interpretation process.\nFor Normal linear regression problems\n(1) a family of prior distributions for θ and σ2 is (Normal inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution to a posterior from the same family of (NIG) distributions or\n(2) alternative families of prior distributions (hierarchical priors) assign an additional layer of distributions to uncertain prior parameters or non-para- metric priors.\nThe NIG prior with known variance σ2 of observations is a conjugate prior distribution. Vague or non-informative prior distributions can be derived from the NIG prior.\nBayesian inference is influenced by\n\nthe uncertainty in the transformation of prior knowledge to prior distributions\nthe assumptions of the statistical model\nthe mistakes in data acquisition\n\nResults\nThe knowledge from related previous experiments (Normal inverse Gamma distributions) allow for analytic posterior calculations of many quantities of interest. @Klauenberg2015\n\nBayesian linear regression and priors (exchangeable and unexchangeable)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe study developed a test of a formal method for augmenting data in linear regression analyses, by incorporating both exchangeable and unexchangeable information on regression coefficients (and standard errors) of previous studies.\nWhy is it important?\nThe frequent combination of multiple testing has relatively low statistical power, which is problematic in null-hypothesis significance testing. Linear regression analyses do not account for the published results and summary statistics from similar previous studies. Ignoring information on parameters from previous studies (relevant and readily available), affects the stability and precision of the parameter estimates and results in lower values than they could have been, resulting in conclusions that are less certain and are affected by sampling variation.\nMultiple linear regression with separate significance tests for all regression coefficients, and with the modest sample sizes, different studies find different sets of statistically significant predictors, and addressing the issue on larger samples is practically unrealistic.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: Bayesian linear regression accommodates prior knowledge, overcoming the absence of formal studies, handles the issues of increasing the sample size, and augments the data of a new study with previous results (regression coefficients and standard errors) from similar studies.\nThe authors used Bayesian linear regression to solve the issue of the univariate case analysis by combining evidence of specific predictors from different linear regression analyses (as in meta-analysis) and found it a better method to resolve the issue of simultaneously combining multiple regression parameters per study, which ignored the relationship between the regression coefficients. Includes summary statistics from previous studies, Bayesian linear regression provided a more acceptable solution when data from previous studies were not (realistically) obtainable.\nModels in the study as categorized the model into - (1) Exchangable - when the current data and previous studies have the same set of predictors. (2) Unexchangable – when the predictors were different in the two.\nTo yield the posterior density that reflects the updated knowledge about the model parameters after having observed the data, the steps to Bayesian linear regression steps are mentioned -\n(1) To calculate the probability density function for the data given the unknown model parameters;\n(2) Taken as a function of those model parameters, the likelihood function is the second part of the prior density function of the model parameters. It quantifies what is assumed to be known about the model parameters before observing the data. The study applied the Standard multiple linear regression model, and with the integration of the prior, provided the joint posterior density using the Gibbs sampler. An Ordinary Least Squares linear regression was then applied to each of these samples to obtain the estimated regression coefficients B and the corresponding standard errors.\n(3) A hierarchical model version was developed in analyzing parameters where studies are not exchangeable.\nResults\nIncorporating priors from previous studies in a linear regression on new data yielded a significantly better parameter estimate with an adequate approximation.\nThe gains in comparison to using just the new data, and the large effects were obtained when the data from previous studies were available, resulting in encouraging performance.\nPerformance of the two versions (exchangeable and unexchangeable) of the replication model was consistently superior to using current data alone.\nThe model developed in the article offers the possibility of obtaining significantly better parameter estimates in a linear regression setting without needing to expend a prohibitive amount of time and energy to obtain data from the previous studies.\nHierarchical version (unexchangeable) of the model offers the advantage of being able to address questions about differences between studies and thus allows for explicit testing of the exchangeability assumption.\nLimitations:\n\nAll studies need to have the same set of predictors.\nThe issue of predictor variables that are correlated. @DeLeeuw2012a\n\n\nBayesian logistic regression (Sequential clinical reasoning approach)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe study aimed to develop models using a longitudinal prospective cohort to predict the risk of incident cardiovascular disease by incorporating demographic features (basic), six metabolic syndrome components (metabolic score), and conventional risk factors (enhanced model). The study participants free of CVD at baseline were followed up over five years, and a Bayesian clinical reasoning model was applied to diagnose new CVD cases.\nWhy is it important?\nEarly diagnosis, prevention, by identifying subjects under the high-risk category for cardiovascular disease (CVD), impacts health interventions.\nLimited availability of molecular information in clinical practice due to being costly and unavailability affects efficient disease diagnosis. To efficiently identify a high-risk population based on the routinely checked biological markers before doing these expensive molecular testsThe requires an alternative approach to analyze data.\nThe Tailored Framingham Risk Score method, for the purpose, is not sufficient because of the differences present in ethnic groups, location, and socio-economic status, as they require the construction of their own models. Heterogeneity (geographic, ethnic group, variations, and different characteristics of social contextual network) often is unobservable and unmeasurable.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: The study evaluated subjects enrolled in a Keelung Community-based Integrated Screening (KCIS) Program, for mass screening (20–79 years) in the Keelung city of Taiwan, who were followed for 5 years to identify incident cancers and chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease).\nThe study classified the risk of having incident CVD cases or death from CVD by dint of available calculated standardized risk score of the MetS components (fasting glucose, blood pressure, HDL-C, triglyceride and waist circumference) together with conventional risk factors (gender, heredity, smoking, alcohol drinking, family history of parent’s CVD and betel quid and other relevant factors).\nEmulating a clinician’s evaluation process, the Bayesian clinical reasoning approach in a sequential manner was applied and three models were developed. The approach considered the normal distribution of regression coefficients of all predictors, allowing for uncertainty of clinical weights. The credible intervals of predicted risk estimates were obtained by averaging out. In the model, the individual risk is elicited by prior speculation (first impression) that is updated by objective observed data (patient’s history and laboratory findings), the regression coefficients for computing risk score were treated as random variable with a certain statistical distribution (e.g. normal distribution) rather than a fixed value (traditional risk prediction model by frequentist). The updated prior distribution with the likelihood of the current data provided a posterior distribution to predict the risk for a specific disease. The sequential approach included -\n\nThe (basic) basic model developed via logistic regression used prior information constructed on gender, age, age2, and time period.\nThe second (classical) model (metabolic score model: MS model) was based on six MetS components.\nThe third (enhanced model) incorporated information on smoking, drinking, betel-quid, and family history of CVD.\n\nResults\nCompared to the basic model and classical model, the enhanced model had better performance. The proposed models predicted CVD incidence at the individual level by incorporating routine information with a sequential Bayesian clinical reasoning approach. Patients’ background significantly contributes to baseline risk. Even with ecological heterogeneity, the regression model adopts individual characteristics and makes individual risk prediction for the CVD incidence.\nLimitations:\n\nWhether the interactions between age, gender, metabolic score, and other risk factors should be included.\nThe use of an enhanced model should be validated through external validation by applying the proposed models to new subjects not included in the training of the model parameters. @Liu2013"

While deep learning is powerful, it typically lacks mechanisms for representing uncertainty or handling limited data in a principled way. Bayesian techniques address these gaps by incorporating uncertainty, prior knowledge, and probabilistic reasoning—making models potentially safer, more trustworthy, and interpretable in clinical settings.\nMethods\n- Conduct a literature survey of recent work combining Bayesian methods with deep learning in healthcare.\n- Categorize approaches such as variational inference, Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble methods, Gaussian processes, and Bayesian neural networks.\n- Map these methods to healthcare tasks like diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning.\n- Evaluate strengths/weaknesses in terms of data availability, computational costs, interpretability, uncertainty calibration, and privacy.\nResults & Limitations\n- Results: BDL has shown success in disease classification, survival analysis, medical image segmentation, and predictive modeling. It often improves uncertainty quantification, may improve generalization, and provides clinicians with added information (e.g., confidence in predictions).\n- Limitations: High computational demands, scalability issues, difficulty specifying priors, and interpretability challenges remain.

    "text": "Comparative Interpretation\n\nEffect stability:\nBayesian estimates closely aligned with frequentist ORs, showing robust inference even under moderate missingness.\nUncertainty quantification:\nBayesian credible intervals were comparable in width to 95% CIs but offered a clearer probabilistic interpretation of uncertainty.\nSurvey weighting:\nThe Bayesian model’s normalized weights approximated the NHANES design effectively, while the MLE incorporated full survey structure directly."

    "text": "Discussion and Conclusion\n\nAll modeling frameworks identified age and BMI as strong independent predictors of doctor-diagnosed diabetes.\n\nBayesian modeling produced stable, interpretable, and well-regularized estimates while fully quantifying uncertainty.\n\nResults were consistent with classical logistic regression but more resilient to potential separation or small-sample issues.\n\nConclusion:\nBayesian logistic regression achieved the study aim — providing more stable and transparent inference than traditional MLE for population-based diabetes risk modeling.\n\nFuture directions:\nExtend Bayesian analysis across multiple NHANES cycles and include biomarker covariates to evaluate nonlinear effects."

Import, merge, and clean NHANES files. 2. Define outcome and predictors. 3. Standardize continuous predictors for numerical stability. 4. Specify the NHANES survey design with proper weights, strata, and PSUs. 5. Perform exploratory visualization and missing data checks. 6. Save cleaned datasets for reproducible downstream modeling."

NHANES exam weights were normalized and used as importance weights, approximating—but not fully reproducing—design-based variance. To mitigate sparsity, we used race3 and adopted an adaptive formula: if a factor collapsed to one level in the selected imputed dataset, that factor was omitted from the Bayesian model. We report posterior ORs with 95% credible intervals for terms retained in the final formula.\nSensitivity: Running the Bayesian model on alternative valid imputations yielded similar age and BMI effects.\nDiagnostics: Convergence and fit were acceptable (\\(\\hat{R} &lt; 1.01\\) and large effective sample sizes). Posterior predictive checks (pp_check) were satisfactory; we also report Bayesian \\(R^2\\)."

BMC Med Inform Decis Mak 25, 123 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-025-02955-3\nProblem: Data curation is challenging as clinical data are heterogeneous in multiple ways. Biomarkers are recorded for different reasons. If missing data imputation is performed, it raises another decision point on whether to impute the continuous or the transformed categorical data.\nAim: Estimating predictive risk factors for disease outcomes with explainable statistical models is desirable for clinical use and decision making. The author provide a guide for modern Bayesian approaches for joint risk factor analysis and variable selection.\nStudy design: Retrospective observational cohort design, lab data linked to the patient data for laboratory markers and clinical outcomes from three hospitals in the Southwest region of England, UK on adults admitted between March to October 2020 and tested positive for SARS CoV-2 by PCR.\nMethod: Analyze range of laboratory blood marker values, Develop cross-validated logistic regression prediction models using the candidate biomarkers, highlighting biomarkers worthy of future research. Employed selection techniques, comparing LASSO frequentist method and Projective Prediction approach on Bayesian logistic regression models with horseshoe priors to illustrate the process of creating a reduced model. They considered models deliver good prediction performance with a small amount of biomarker data.\nVairables (1) Predictors: Includes a variety of clinical severity indices, lab biomarkers (microbiological, immunological, haematological and biochemistry) as parameters used as predictive variables in the regression models.\n\nOutcome: The primary prediction outcome was death or transfer to the ICU.\n\nData management: Continuous biomarkers were trannsfromed into categorical variables (reference ranges for clinical use).\nStaistical calcukation: Analytics carried out using the R statistical language using- Standard logistic regression analyses used the R Stats GLM package (v4.4.1); LASSO analyses, GLMnet (v4.1.8); and for Bayesian analyses, BRMS (v2.22.0) and ProjPred (v2.8.0).\nBefore running full regression models, the independent contribution of individual biomarkers were examined in the training dataset predicting ICU entry or death via standard logistic regressions and Bayesian logistic regressions with either a flat (aka uniform) or horseshoe prior and calculated p-values and odds ratios for each biomarker.\nPer biomarker, patients with and without the outcome were separated and then these groups were shuffled and split into 5 equal subgroups. These groups were then paired at random, to ensure training and test datasets have the same proportion of patients with a severe outcome as in full the sample for that biomarker. This was to improve the chance of convergence for biomarkers with high data missingness and only complete cases of training data available for each biomarker were considered for the study.\nEach individual biomarker model including age and gender (except univariate age and gender models) were compared against a standard model including only age and gender. Regressions were fit using all associated dummy variables for a given biomarker (e.g. ‘Mild’, ‘Moderate’, ‘Severe’) using ‘Normal’ as the reference.\nAnalysis using all valid biomarker data: After individual biomarker evaluation, logistic regression models considering all valid biomarkers (Prediction using individual variables section) and demographic variables were fit to the data and the predictions were tested via internal and external validation using the stratified cross-validation procedures.\nAnalysis using reduced variable models: Considering that eben though a model using all biomarker data may have strong predictive power, but clinically a strong prediction with the least amount of biomarkers might save on time, money and other resources, they used LASSO and Bayesian Projective Prediction methodologies to choose reduced variable models to predict COVID-19 severe outcomes.\nTo estimate variability in model performance and allow comparison between models, we compute inter-quantile AUC difference ranges using 5-fold 20-repeat cross-validation of models\nReduced variable models: LASSO and projective prediction performed for creation of reduced models with fewer biomarkers.\nModel performance evaluation and dissemination They chose to peform cross-validated estimates of AUC, sensitivity, and specificity and the Inter-quartile intervals over these measures.\nRecommendations: Categorization is worth critical consideration in model planning Reduced number of variables Imputation Bayesian approaches should include that coefficients estimated via Bayes should on average deliver better predictive performance than standard GLM"

Electronic health records (EHRs) could improve diagnostic accuracy and predict treatment effects. Visualizations of characteristics of posterior distributions can be immediately understood by clinicians and patients as relevant to their decision. Combining prior knowledge and patient data with evidence could predict the patient’s health status, trajectory, and/or likely benefits of interventions.\nHow is it solved?\nMethod: The authors applied Bayesian hierarchical regression for multivariate longitudinal patient data using open-source R-packages and developed 2 levels—time within person and persons within a population\nThe model combined exogenous (eg, age, clinical history) factors and endogenous (eg, current treatment) variables on the individual’s multivariate health measurements and the effects of health measurements at one time on subsequent interventions.\nThe model produced an estimate of the posterior distribution for each value of the predictor variable and an estimate of the marginal distribution of the regression coefficients for each coefficient that measures the outcome (health status) associated with its predictor variables. In a larger sample, the likelihood dominates the prior distribution for regression coefficients and Bayesian hierarchical model used a likelihood-based approach, used priors (prior laboratory and clinical trials data) that provided the assay sensitivities, which through the prior assumptions, made the model identifiable and the integration of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates the posterior distributions, avoided missing data and complex outcome measurements.\nResults/limitations\nThree case studies: pneumonia etiology in children, prostate cancer, and mental disorders chosen for model development, identified low-risk patient population, reduced the risk of overtreatment, complications, adverse effects, and financial burden for patients (Disease Reclassification). Prostate cancer software was then implemented within the JHM HER.\nLimitation:\nModels were entirely parametric, and extensions to nonparametric or more flexible parametric models were recommended to improve approaches for neuroimage or genomic data.\nApplications:\n\nto scale a tool that addresses a particular unmet need across a larger, more diverse population of patients and clinicians\nuse in autoimmune diseases, sudden cardiac arrest, and diabetes.\nembed a collection of tools to acquire and use the most relevant information, agnostic to its level of measurement, to improve population and individual health decisions that cause better outcomes at more affordable costs. @Zeger2020\n\n\nBayesian Inference (parametric vs non-parametric)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe authors calculated the posterior probability of disease diagnosis and applied Bayesian inference to develop three modules comparing parametric (with a fixed set of parameters) and nonparametric distributions (which do not make a priori assumptions) by analyzing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset from two separate diagnostic tests on both diseased and non-diseased populations.\nWhy is it important?\nMedical diagnosis, treatment, and management decisions are crucial, and conventional methods for diagnosis using clinical criteria and fixed numerical thresholds limit the capture of other information related to the intricate relationship between diagnostic tests and the varying prevalence of diseases. The probability distributions associated with quantitative diagnostic test outcomes often demonstrate some overlap between the diseased and nondiseased groups. The dichotomous method fails to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of disease presentations across diverse populations. The applicability of the normal distribution (conventional method) is critiqued, especially in dealing with clinical measurands having skewness, bimodality, or multimodality.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: The Authors developed models employing Bayesian inference (Bayesian diagnostic approach) to calculate the posterior probability of @Liu2013"

For this project, we developed and implemented statistical methods called bayesian hierarchical models that combine existing data on past clinical experience from a reference population with new measurements for the individual. Clinicians currently use such methods when screening patients for disease. Modern technologies make it possible for this proven approach to extend far beyond its current use. The recent revolution in information technology has unleashed new types of health data, from DNA sequences to functional images of the brain to patient-reported outcomes. Furthermore, the electronic health record captures every patient’s sequence of health measurements, diagnoses, and treatments. The bayesian methods developed and reported on here combine even complex data to produce predictions about an individual patient’s health status, trajectory, and likely benefits and harms of interventions. In addition to developing novel methods, we facilitated their use by creating and locally disseminating a software package, OSLER inHealth, that will allow other researchers to apply this methodology. The software repository is open-source and includes the methodology developed as part of this research as well as other existing methods that facilitate individualized health prediction. We have tested the proposed methods and software on 3 case studies to (1) estimate the frequency with which various pathogens cause children’s pneumonia and predict which pathogen is likely to be causing a particular child’s pneumonia given her or his clinical data, potentially reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics; (2) infer whether a prostate cancer is indolent or aggressive for a patient under active surveillance; and (3) characterize the variation in multiple, time-varying symptoms of major mental disorders, including schizophrenia and depression, and then use this knowledge to provide patient-specific estimates of past and, likely, future trajectories. With this project, we have developed and demonstrated the value of combining even complex measurements on a population of patients, then translating this experience into more valid assessments of a new patient’s health status and trajectory. The model also supports inferences about the likely benefits and harms associated with available interventions. Copyright {} 2020. Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Yet, a regression model cannot be uniquely formulated as a measurement function, and consequently the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements are not applicable directly. Bayesian inference, however, is well suited to regression tasks, and has the advantage of accounting for additional a priori information, which typically robustifies analyses. Furthermore, it is anticipated that future revisions of the GUM shall also embrace the Bayesian view. Guidance on Bayesian inference for regression tasks is largely lacking in metrology. For linear regression models with Gaussian measurement errors this tutorial gives explicit guidance. Divided into three steps, the tutorial first illustrates how a priori knowledge, which is available from previous experiments, can be translated into prior distributions from a specific class. These prior distributions have the advantage of yielding analytical, closed form results, thus avoiding the need to apply numerical methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Secondly, formulas for the posterior results are given, explained and illustrated, and software implementations are provided. In the third step, Bayesian tools are used to assess the assumptions behind the suggested approach. These three steps (prior elicitation, posterior calculation, and robustness to prior uncertainty and model adequacy) are critical to Bayesian inference. The general guidance given here for Normal linear regression tasks is accompanied by a simple, but real-world, metrological example. The calibration of a flow device serves as a running example and illustrates the three steps.

The goal of this article is therefore to develop a Bayesian model in which a linear regression analysis on current data is augmented with the reported regression coefficients (and standard errors) of previous studies. Two versions of this model are presented. The first version incorporates previous studies through the prior density and is applicable when the current and all previous studies are exchangeable. The second version models all studies in a hierarchical structure and is applicable when studies are not exchangeable. Both versions of the model are assessed using simulation studies. Performance for each in estimating the regression coefficients is consistently superior to using current data alone and is close to that of an equivalent model that uses the data from previous studies rather than reported regression coefficients. Overall the results show that augmenting data with results from previous studies is viable and yields significant improvements in the parameter estimation. {} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.}, author = {de Leeuw, Christiaan and Klugkist, Irene}, doi = {10.1080/00273171.2012.673957}, file = {:C:/Users/Namita/Downloads/Augmenting Data With Published Results in Bayesian Linear Regression.pdf:pdf}, issn = {00273171}, journal = {Multivariate Behavioral Research}, mendeley-groups = {CapStone_2025}, number = {3}, pages = {369–391}, title = {{Augmenting Data With Published Results in Bayesian Linear Regression}}, volume = {47}, year = {2012} }\n@article{Liu2013, abstract = {Background: A Bayesian clinical reasoning model was developed to predict an individual risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) for desk-top reference. Methods: Three Bayesian models were constructed to estimate the CVD risk by sequentially incorporating demographic features (basic), six metabolic syndrome components (metabolic score) and conventional risk factors (enhanced model). By considering clinical weights (regression coefficients) of each model as normal distribution, individual risk can be predicted making allowance for uncertainty of clinical weights. A community-based cohort that enrolled 64,489 participants free of CVD at baseline and followed up over five years to ascertain newly diagnosed CVD cases during the period through 2000 to 2004 was used for the illustration of the three proposed models (full empirical data are available from website http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/\\(\\sim\\)chenlin/CVD-prediction-data.rar). Results: The proposed models can be applied to predicting the CVD risk with any combination of risk factors. For a 47-year-old man, the five-year risk for CVD with the basic model was 11.2% (95% CI: 7.8%-15.6%). His metabolic syndrome score, leading to 1.488 of likelihood ratio, enhanced the risk for CVD up to 15.8% (95% CI: 11.0%-21.5%) and put him in highest deciles. As with the habit of smoking over 2 packs per-day and family history of CVD, yielding the likelihood ratios of 1.62 and 1.47, respectively, the risk was further raised to 30.9% (95% CI: 20.7%-39.8%). Conclusions: We demonstrate how to make individual risk prediction for CVD by incorporating routine information with a sequential Bayesian clinical reasoning approach. {} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}, author = {Liu, Yi Ming and Chen, Sam Li Sheng and Yen, Amy Ming Fang and Chen, Hsiu Hsi}, doi = {10.1016/J.IJCARD.2012.05.016}, file = {:C:/Users/Namita/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Liu et al. - 2013 - Individual risk prediction model for incident cardiovascular disease A Bayesian clinical reasoning approach(9).pdf:pdf}, issn = {0167-5273}, journal = {International Journal of Cardiology}, keywords = {Bayes’ theorem,Bayesian,Cardiovascular disease,Likelihood ratio,Metabolic syndrome,Prediction model}, mendeley-groups = {CapStone_2025}, month = {sep}, number = {5}, pages = {2008–2012}, pmid = {22658349}, publisher = {Elsevier}, title = {{Individual risk prediction model for incident cardiovascular disease: A Bayesian clinical reasoning approach}}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527312006274}, volume = {167}, year = {2013} }"

The study concludes by presenting a clinical decision tool that uses the most important factors for patient risk stratification based on available information at different stages of hospitalization.\n\n\n\nThe central problem this research aims to solve is how to accurately and quickly predict which hospitalized COVID-19 patients face the highest risk of death. Because hospitalization rates remained high and the disease caused millions of deaths globally, there was an urgent need to identify factors that predict severe disease and mortality to improve patient care and outcomes. The developed model is intended to allow for prioritization at the systems level and the individualization of care for each patient.\nA major shortcoming of previous prognostic tools was that they were static. Existing models generally looked at patient data and biomarkers only at the time of hospital admission to predict a single outcome, like death, at a single future time point. However, the sources note that a patient’s risk changes constantly during hospitalization, as biomarkers show outcome-specific dynamic changes. Existing models struggled to incorporate these dynamic changes and had difficulty handling the competing risks a patient faces, like remaining in the hospital, being discharged, or dying. Failing to account for these ongoing changes meant that risk predictions were often inaccurate in real-time clinical settings.\nTherefore, the authors developed a “Dynamic Bayesian Model” to overcome these limitations. This new model combines a patient’s initial information (demographics and comorbidities) with daily dynamic changes in laboratory test values throughout their hospital stay. By incorporating these time-dependent measurements, the model achieved dramatic improvements in predictive accuracy compared to models that relied only on admission data. This allows the model to provide daily adjustments to the patient’s in-hospital mortality risk, making it a more effective tool for clinicians deciding on appropriate care and resource allocation.\n\n\n\n\nCase selection\n\nPatients admitted to SUNY Downstate Medical Center, with COVID-19 related symptoms, between February 2020 and March 2020.\n\nSample\n\n553 PCR-positive patients included in the study.\nStratified into two groups: 200 patients who were discharged and 200 patients who died.\nData collected: demographic information, comorbidities, and laboratory test values.\n\nStatistical modeling approaches\n\nThe researchers conducted two main sets of analyses, both estimated using a Bayesian framework:\n\nDynamic Bayesian Markov Model\n\nThe primary goal was to develop a prognostic Markiv model that incorporates dynamic laboratory values with patients’ admission profiles.\nMarkov model accounts for competing risks (discharge vs. death) and allows for daily updates to mortality risk based on changing lab values.\nPredictor sets included:\n\nDemographics, comorbidities, admission, and lab values.\n\nThe model structure included:\n\nSecondary methodology: Logistic Regression Analysis\n\nThis analysis was conducted to determine factors most predictive of patient mortality but was specifically not intended to assess dynamic changes in mortality risk.

    "section": "",
    "text": "An introduction to using Bayesian linear regression with clinical data\nScott A. Baldwin, Michael J. Larson\nBehaviour Research and Therapy, Volume 98, 2017, Pages 58-75\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2016.12.016\n\nSummary\nThis paper provides an introduction to Bayesian linear regression within the context of clinical data analysis. It contrasts Bayesian methodologies with traditional frequentist methods, highlighting the limitations of the latter, particularly in relation to p-values and confidence intervals. The article explains fundamental Bayesian concepts such as priors, likelihood, and posterior distributions. It presents an example using electroencephalogram (EEG) and anxiety study data to demonstrate the relationship between error-related negativity (ERN) and trait anxiety. It also covers practical aspects like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, assessing model convergence, interpreting credible intervals, and evaluating model fit using WAIC and LOO-CV, extending the discussion to other models like logistic and Poisson regression.\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of the paper is to introduce Bayesian linear regression techniques to researchers in clinical psychology and related fields, demonstrating how these methods can provide more informative and nuanced insights compared to traditional frequentist approaches.\n\n\nWhat is the problem being addressed?\nThe problem being addressed is the limitations of frequentist statistical methods, particularly the reliance on p-values and confidence intervals, which can lead to misinterpretations and less informative results in clinical data analysis. ### Why is it important? It is important because clinical data often involve complexities such as small sample sizes, missing data, and hierarchical structures that traditional methods may not handle well. Bayesian methods offer a more flexible and robust framework for analyzing such data, leading to better-informed clinical decisions and research outcomes. ### What are the key results? Key results include a detailed explanation of Bayesian linear regression concepts, a practical example using EEG and anxiety data, and guidance on implementing Bayesian methods using software like R and Stan. The paper also discusses how to assess model convergence and fit, providing a comprehensive overview of Bayesian analysis in a clinical context. ### What are the limitations of the paper? Limitations of the paper include its focus on linear regression, which may not cover all types of clinical data analysis needs."

Daniels\nStatistical Science, Vol.39, No. 2, 286-304, May 2024\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13998\n\n\nThis paper introduces a novel method for variable selection in regression models using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). The authors propose a permutation-based approach to assess the importance of each predictor variable by comparing the model’s performance with and without the variable. This method allows for the identification of relevant predictors while accounting for complex interactions and nonlinear relationships inherent in BART models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulations and real-world applications, showing that it outperforms traditional variable selection methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability.\n\n\n\nIn regression analysis, identifying the most relevant predictor variables is crucial for building accurate and interpretable models. Traditional variable selection methods often struggle with complex data structures, such as nonlinear relationships and interactions among predictors. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) offer a flexible modeling framework that can capture these complexities, but they lack built-in mechanisms for variable selection. The challenge addressed in this paper is to develop a robust method for selecting important variables within the BART framework, enabling researchers to leverage BART’s strengths while ensuring model interpretability.\n\n\n\nThe authors propose a permutation-based variable selection method within the BART framework. The key steps of the methodology are as follows: 1. Fit a BART model to the data using all predictor variables. 2. For each predictor variable, create a permuted version of the dataset by randomly shuffling the values of that variable while keeping the other variables unchanged. 3. Fit a BART model to the permuted dataset and evaluate its performance using a suitable metric (e.g., mean squared error). 4. Compare the performance of the original BART model with the permuted model. A significant drop in performance when a variable is permuted indicates that the variable is important for predicting the outcome. 5. Repeat the permutation process multiple times to obtain a distribution of performance metrics for each variable, allowing for statistical inference about variable importance. 6. Select variables based on their importance scores, using a threshold to determine which variables are considered relevant. 7. The authors validate their method through extensive simulations and applications to real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying important predictors while accounting for complex interactions and nonlinearities.\n\n\n\nThe proposed permutation-based variable selection method using BART was evaluated through simulations and real-world applications. The results showed that the method effectively identified important predictor variables, outperforming traditional variable selection techniques in terms of accuracy and interpretability. The authors reported that their approach was able to capture complex interactions and nonlinear relationships among predictors, leading to improved model performance. Additionally, the method provided a clear ranking of variable importance, facilitating the interpretation of results. Overall, the findings suggest that the proposed method is a valuable tool for variable selection in regression models, particularly when using BART.\n\n\n\n\nThe paper introduced three new variable selection approaches: (1) a permutation-based approach using within-type BART Variable Inclusion Proportion (VIP), (2) a permutation-based approach using BART Metropolis Importance (MI), and (3) a backward selection procedure with two filters.\nThese new approaches were designed specifically to address issues with existing methods, such as being biased against categorical predictors and being conservative in including relevant predictors, particularly in data settings with mixed-type predictors (e.g., continuous and binary).\nBased on the simulation results, where success was defined as an excellent capability of including all relevant predictors (rmiss \\(\\le 0.1\\)) and acceptable capability of excluding irrelevant predictors (precision \\(\\ge 0.6\\)), the three proposed approaches consistently perform well in identifying all the relevant predictors and excluding irrelevant predictors.\n\nRanking of Successful Approaches (by Success Rate)\nThe backward selection approach with two filters achieves the highest success rate (70.8%) across the various simulation scenarios tested. The two new permutation-based approaches followed closely in performance: 1. Backward selection with two filters: 70.8% success rate. 2.

Continuous variables (age, bmi) were imputed using normal regression for age and predictive mean matching (PMM) for bmi, while categorical variables (sex, race3) used logistic or polytomous regression.\nFive imputed datasets (m = 5) were generated and analyzed separately; estimates were then pooled using Rubin’s rules to obtain combined parameter estimates and standard errors.\nThe pooled results, in Table 2, show strong positive associations between age and BMI with diabetes risk, as well as higher odds for males and non-White racial/ethnic groups relative to Whites. The direction and magnitude of effects are consistent with the design-based MLE model, confirming that imputation did not meaningfully alter the relationships among variables.\n\n\n2.3 Bayesian Logistic Regression\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare a single imputed dataset (from MICE results)\n\nadult_imp1 &lt;- mice::complete(imp, 1) %&gt;%\ndplyr::mutate(\nsex   = factor(sex,   levels = levels(adult$sex)),\nrace3 = factor(race3, levels = levels(adult$race3)),\nage_c = as.numeric(scale(age)),\nbmi_c = as.numeric(scale(bmi)),\nwt_norm = WTMEC2YR / mean(WTMEC2YR, na.rm = TRUE)\n) %&gt;%\ndplyr::filter(!is.na(diabetes_ind), !is.na(age_c), !is.na(bmi_c)) %&gt;%\ndroplevels()\n\n# Define model formula\n\nfml_bayes &lt;- diabetes_ind | weights(wt_norm) ~ age_c + bmi_c + sex + race3\n\n# Specify weakly informative priors\n\npriors &lt;- c(\nbrms::set_prior(\"normal(0, 2.5)\", class = \"b\"),\nbrms::set_prior(\"student_t(3, 0, 10)\", class = \"Intercept\")\n)\n\n# Fit Bayesian logistic regression\n\nbayes_fit &lt;- brms::brm(\nformula = fml_bayes,\ndata    = adult_imp1,\nfamily  = bernoulli(link = \"logit\"),\nprior   = priors,\nchains  = 4, iter = 2000, seed = 123,\ncontrol = list(adapt_delta = 0.95),\nrefresh = 0\n)\n\n\nRunning MCMC with 4 sequential chains...\n\nChain 1 finished in 11.9 seconds.\nChain 2 finished in 10.0 seconds.\nChain 3 finished in 10.7 seconds.\nChain 4 finished in 9.7 seconds.\n\nAll 4 chains finished successfully.\nMean chain execution time: 10.6 seconds.\nTotal execution time: 42.9 seconds.\n\n\nCode\n# Extract posterior summaries and transform to odds ratios\n\nbayes_or &lt;- brms::posterior_summary(bayes_fit, pars = \"^b_\") %&gt;%\nas.data.frame() %&gt;%\ntibble::rownames_to_column(\"raw\") %&gt;%\ndplyr::mutate(\nterm = gsub(\"^b_\", \"\", raw),\nOR   = exp(Estimate),\nLCL  = exp(Q2.5),\nUCL  = exp(Q97.5)\n) %&gt;%\ndplyr::select(term, OR, LCL, UCL)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nknitr::kable(\n  dplyr::mutate(bayes_or, dplyr::across(c(OR, LCL, UCL), ~ round(.x, 2)))\n)\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Bayesian logistic regression: posterior odds ratios (OR) with 95% credible intervals for diabetes diagnosis among adults (NHANES 2013–2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nOR\nLCL\nUCL\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n0.06\n0.05\n0.07\n\n\nage_c\n2.93\n2.63\n3.29\n\n\nbmi_c\n1.91\n1.75\n2.09\n\n\nsexMale\n1.29\n1.07\n1.56\n\n\nrace3Hispanic\n1.81\n1.38\n2.40\n\n\nrace3Black\n1.62\n1.22\n2.12\n\n\nrace3Other\n2.13\n1.50\n2.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Table 3, this Bayesian logistic regression model estimates the log-odds of diabetes using standardized predictors.\n\nWeakly informative priors (Normal(0, 2.5) for slopes; Student-t(3, 0, 10) for the intercept) help stabilize estimation and prevent overfitting.\n\nPosterior means and 95% credible intervals (CrI) provide full uncertainty quantification for each predictor, enabling direct probabilistic interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Posterior predictive check: observed vs. replicated outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nknitr::kable(as.data.frame(brms::bayes_R2(bayes_fit)))\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Bayesian R² summary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate\nEst.Error\nQ2.5\nQ97.5\n\n\n\n\nR2\n0.1362163\n0.0119056\n0.1135586\n0.1601284\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: MCMC diagnostics (R-hat and Effective Sample Sizes) for slope parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nRhat\nBulk_ESS\nTail_ESS\n\n\n\n\nb_Intercept\n1\n2970.3\n3006.3\n\n\nb_age_c\n1\n2896.8\n2962.4\n\n\nb_bmi_c\n1\n3068.0\n2892.7\n\n\nb_sexMale\n1\n4033.9\n2809.7\n\n\nb_race3Hispanic\n1\n4099.9\n2520.5\n\n\nb_race3Black\n1\n3224.0\n3167.4\n\n\nb_race3Other\n1\n3875.5\n3325.8"
