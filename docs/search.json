    "text": "Chuji Luo, Michael J. Daniels\nStatistical Science, Vol.39, No. 2, 286-304, May 2024\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13998\n\n\nThis paper introduces a novel method for variable selection in regression models using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). The authors propose a permutation-based approach to assess the importance of each predictor variable by comparing the model’s performance with and without the variable. This method allows for the identification of relevant predictors while accounting for complex interactions and nonlinear relationships inherent in BART models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulations and real-world applications, showing that it outperforms traditional variable selection methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability.\n\n\n\nIn regression analysis, identifying the most relevant predictor variables is crucial for building accurate and interpretable models. Traditional variable selection methods often struggle with complex data structures, such as nonlinear relationships and interactions among predictors. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) offer a flexible modeling framework that can capture these complexities, but they lack built-in mechanisms for variable selection. The challenge addressed in this paper is to develop a robust method for selecting important variables within the BART framework, enabling researchers to leverage BART’s strengths while ensuring model interpretability.\n\n\n\nThe authors propose a permutation-based variable selection method within the BART framework. The key steps of the methodology are as follows: 1. Fit a BART model to the data using all predictor variables. 2. For each predictor variable, create a permuted version of the dataset by randomly shuffling the values of that variable while keeping the other variables unchanged. 3. Fit a BART model to the permuted dataset and evaluate its performance using a suitable metric (e.g., mean squared error). 4. Compare the performance of the original BART model with the permuted model. A significant drop in performance when a variable is permuted indicates that the variable is important for predicting the outcome. 5. Repeat the permutation process multiple times to obtain a distribution of performance metrics for each variable, allowing for statistical inference about variable importance. 6. Select variables based on their importance scores, using a threshold to determine which variables are considered relevant. 7. The authors validate their method through extensive simulations and applications to real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying important predictors while accounting for complex interactions and nonlinearities.\n\n\n\nThe proposed permutation-based variable selection method using BART was evaluated through simulations and real-world applications.

    "title": "An introduction to using Bayesian linear regression with clinical data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An introduction to using Bayesian linear regression with clinical data\nScott A. Baldwin, Michael J. Larson\nBehaviour Research and Therapy, Volume 98, 2017, Pages 58-75\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2016.12.016\n\nSummary\nThis paper provides an introduction to Bayesian linear regression within the context of clinical data analysis. It contrasts Bayesian methodologies with traditional frequentist methods, highlighting the limitations of the latter, particularly in relation to p-values and confidence intervals. The article explains fundamental Bayesian concepts such as priors, likelihood, and posterior distributions. It presents an example using electroencephalogram (EEG) and anxiety study data to demonstrate the relationship between error-related negativity (ERN) and trait anxiety. It also covers practical aspects like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, assessing model convergence, interpreting credible intervals, and evaluating model fit using WAIC and LOO-CV, extending the discussion to other models like logistic and Poisson regression.\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of the paper is to introduce Bayesian linear regression techniques to researchers in clinical psychology and related fields, demonstrating how these methods can provide more informative and nuanced insights compared to traditional frequentist approaches.\n\n\nWhat is the problem being addressed?\nThe problem being addressed is the limitations of frequentist statistical methods, particularly the reliance on p-values and confidence intervals, which can lead to misinterpretations and less informative results in clinical data analysis. ### Why is it important? It is important because clinical data often involve complexities such as small sample sizes, missing data, and hierarchical structures that traditional methods may not handle well. Bayesian methods offer a more flexible and robust framework for analyzing such data, leading to better-informed clinical decisions and research outcomes. ### What are the key results? Key results include a detailed explanation of Bayesian linear regression concepts, a practical example using EEG and anxiety data, and guidance on implementing Bayesian methods using software like R and Stan. The paper also discusses how to assess model convergence and fit, providing a comprehensive overview of Bayesian analysis in a clinical context. ### What are the limitations of the paper? Limitations of the paper include its focus on linear regression, which may not cover all types of clinical data analysis needs."

Rep. 2021, 13, 239–250. https://doi.org/10.3390/idr13010027\n\n\nTHis paper describes a study that used a Bayesian Markov model to better predict mortality risk for hospitalized COVID-19 patients by incorporating dynamic changes in laboratory values over time, rather than relying solely on admission data. The researchers collected demographic, comorbidity, and lab data for 553 PCR-positive patients and found that factors like age over 80 and certain comorbidities increased risk, but including dynamic changes in biomarkers significantly improved the predictive accuracy of the model. The study concludes by presenting a clinical decision tool that uses the most important factors for patient risk stratification based on available information at different stages of hospitalization.\n\n\n\nThe central problem this research aims to solve is how to accurately and quickly predict which hospitalized COVID-19 patients face the highest risk of death. Because hospitalization rates remained high and the disease caused millions of deaths globally, there was an urgent need to identify factors that predict severe disease and mortality to improve patient care and outcomes. The developed model is intended to allow for prioritization at the systems level and the individualization of care for each patient.\nA major shortcoming of previous prognostic tools was that they were static. Existing models generally looked at patient data and biomarkers only at the time of hospital admission to predict a single outcome, like death, at a single future time point. However, the sources note that a patient’s risk changes constantly during hospitalization, as biomarkers show outcome-specific dynamic changes. Existing models struggled to incorporate these dynamic changes and had difficulty handling the competing risks a patient faces, like remaining in the hospital, being discharged, or dying. Failing to account for these ongoing changes meant that risk predictions were often inaccurate in real-time clinical settings.\nTherefore, the authors developed a “Dynamic Bayesian Model” to overcome these limitations. This new model combines a patient’s initial information (demographics and comorbidities) with daily dynamic changes in laboratory test values throughout their hospital stay. By incorporating these time-dependent measurements, the model achieved dramatic improvements in predictive accuracy compared to models that relied only on admission data. This allows the model to provide daily adjustments to the patient’s in-hospital mortality risk, making it a more effective tool for clinicians deciding on appropriate care and resource allocation.\n\n\n\n\nCase selection\n\nPatients admitted to SUNY Downstate Medical Center, with COVID-19 related symptoms, between February 2020 and March 2020.\n\nSample\n\n553 PCR-positive patients included in the study.\nStratified into two groups: 200 patients who were discharged and 200 patients who died.\nData collected: demographic information, comorbidities, and laboratory test values.\n\nStatistical modeling approaches\n\nThe researchers conducted two main sets of analyses, both estimated using a Bayesian framework:\n\nDynamic Bayesian Markov Model\n\nThe primary goal was to develop a prognostic Markiv model that incorporates dynamic laboratory values with patients’ admission profiles.\nMarkov model accounts for competing risks (discharge vs. death) and allows for daily updates to mortality risk based on changing lab values.\nPredictor sets included:\n\nDemographics, comorbidities, admission, and lab values.\n\nThe model structure included:\n\nSecondary methodology: Logistic Regression Analysis\n\nThis analysis was conducted to determine factors most predictive of patient mortality but was specifically not intended to assess dynamic changes in mortality risk.

For this project, we developed and implemented statistical methods called bayesian hierarchical models that combine existing data on past clinical experience from a reference population with new measurements for the individual. Clinicians currently use such methods when screening patients for disease. Modern technologies make it possible for this proven approach to extend far beyond its current use. The recent revolution in information technology has unleashed new types of health data, from DNA sequences to functional images of the brain to patient-reported outcomes. Furthermore, the electronic health record captures every patient’s sequence of health measurements, diagnoses, and treatments. The bayesian methods developed and reported on here combine even complex data to produce predictions about an individual patient’s health status, trajectory, and likely benefits and harms of interventions. In addition to developing novel methods, we facilitated their use by creating and locally disseminating a software package, OSLER inHealth, that will allow other researchers to apply this methodology. The software repository is open-source and includes the methodology developed as part of this research as well as other existing methods that facilitate individualized health prediction. We have tested the proposed methods and software on 3 case studies to (1) estimate the frequency with which various pathogens cause children’s pneumonia and predict which pathogen is likely to be causing a particular child’s pneumonia given her or his clinical data, potentially reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics; (2) infer whether a prostate cancer is indolent or aggressive for a patient under active surveillance; and (3) characterize the variation in multiple, time-varying symptoms of major mental disorders, including schizophrenia and depression, and then use this knowledge to provide patient-specific estimates of past and, likely, future trajectories. With this project, we have developed and demonstrated the value of combining even complex measurements on a population of patients, then translating this experience into more valid assessments of a new patient’s health status and trajectory. The model also supports inferences about the likely benefits and harms associated with available interventions. Copyright {} 2020. Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Yet, a regression model cannot be uniquely formulated as a measurement function, and consequently the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements are not applicable directly. Bayesian inference, however, is well suited to regression tasks, and has the advantage of accounting for additional a priori information, which typically robustifies analyses. Furthermore, it is anticipated that future revisions of the GUM shall also embrace the Bayesian view. Guidance on Bayesian inference for regression tasks is largely lacking in metrology. For linear regression models with Gaussian measurement errors this tutorial gives explicit guidance. Divided into three steps, the tutorial first illustrates how a priori knowledge, which is available from previous experiments, can be translated into prior distributions from a specific class. These prior distributions have the advantage of yielding analytical, closed form results, thus avoiding the need to apply numerical methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Secondly, formulas for the posterior results are given, explained and illustrated, and software implementations are provided. In the third step, Bayesian tools are used to assess the assumptions behind the suggested approach. These three steps (prior elicitation, posterior calculation, and robustness to prior uncertainty and model adequacy) are critical to Bayesian inference.

Although the prior density in Bayesian linear regression could accommodate such prior knowledge, formal models for doing so are absent from the literature. The goal of this article is therefore to develop a Bayesian model in which a linear regression analysis on current data is augmented with the reported regression coefficients (and standard errors) of previous studies. Two versions of this model are presented. The first version incorporates previous studies through the prior density and is applicable when the current and all previous studies are exchangeable. The second version models all studies in a hierarchical structure and is applicable when studies are not exchangeable. Both versions of the model are assessed using simulation studies. Performance for each in estimating the regression coefficients is consistently superior to using current data alone and is close to that of an equivalent model that uses the data from previous studies rather than reported regression coefficients. Overall the results show that augmenting data with results from previous studies is viable and yields significant improvements in the parameter estimation. {} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.}, author = {de Leeuw, Christiaan and Klugkist, Irene}, doi = {10.1080/00273171.2012.673957}, file = {:C:/Users/Namita/Downloads/Augmenting Data With Published Results in Bayesian Linear Regression.pdf:pdf}, issn = {00273171}, journal = {Multivariate Behavioral Research}, mendeley-groups = {CapStone_2025}, number = {3}, pages = {369–391}, title = {{Augmenting Data With Published Results in Bayesian Linear Regression}}, volume = {47}, year = {2012} }\n@article{Liu2013, abstract = {Background: A Bayesian clinical reasoning model was developed to predict an individual risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) for desk-top reference. Methods: Three Bayesian models were constructed to estimate the CVD risk by sequentially incorporating demographic features (basic), six metabolic syndrome components (metabolic score) and conventional risk factors (enhanced model). By considering clinical weights (regression coefficients) of each model as normal distribution, individual risk can be predicted making allowance for uncertainty of clinical weights. A community-based cohort that enrolled 64,489 participants free of CVD at baseline and followed up over five years to ascertain newly diagnosed CVD cases during the period through 2000 to 2004 was used for the illustration of the three proposed models (full empirical data are available from website http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/\\(\\sim\\)chenlin/CVD-prediction-data.rar). Results: The proposed models can be applied to predicting the CVD risk with any combination of risk factors. For a 47-year-old man, the five-year risk for CVD with the basic model was 11.2% (95% CI: 7.8%-15.6%). His metabolic syndrome score, leading to 1.488 of likelihood ratio, enhanced the risk for CVD up to 15.8% (95% CI: 11.0%-21.5%) and put him in highest deciles. As with the habit of smoking over 2 packs per-day and family history of CVD, yielding the likelihood ratios of 1.62 and 1.47, respectively, the risk was further raised to 30.9% (95% CI: 20.7%-39.8%). Conclusions: We demonstrate how to make individual risk prediction for CVD by incorporating routine information with a sequential Bayesian clinical reasoning approach. {} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}, author = {Liu, Yi Ming and Chen, Sam Li Sheng and Yen, Amy Ming Fang and Chen, Hsiu Hsi}, doi = {10.1016/J.IJCARD.2012.05.016}, file = {:C:/Users/Namita/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Liu et al. - 2013 - Individual risk prediction model for incident cardiovascular disease A Bayesian clinical reasoning approach(9).pdf:pdf}, issn = {0167-5273}, journal = {International Journal of Cardiology}, keywords = {Bayes’ theorem,Bayesian,Cardiovascular disease,Likelihood ratio,Metabolic syndrome,Prediction model}, mendeley-groups = {CapStone_2025}, month = {sep}, number = {5}, pages = {2008–2012}, pmid = {22658349}, publisher = {Elsevier}, title = {{Individual risk prediction model for incident cardiovascular disease: A Bayesian clinical reasoning approach}}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527312006274}, volume = {167}, year = {2013} }"

Electronic health records (EHRs) could improve diagnostic accuracy and predict treatment effects. Visualizations of characteristics of posterior distributions can be immediately understood by clinicians and patients as relevant to their decision. Combining prior knowledge and patient data with evidence could predict the patient’s health status, trajectory, and/or likely benefits of interventions.\nHow is it solved?\nMethod: The authors applied Bayesian hierarchical regression for multivariate longitudinal patient data using open-source R-packages and developed 2 levels—time within person and persons within a population\nThe model combined exogenous (eg, age, clinical history) factors and endogenous (eg, current treatment) variables on the individual’s multivariate health measurements and the effects of health measurements at one time on subsequent interventions.\nThe model produced an estimate of the posterior distribution for each value of the predictor variable and an estimate of the marginal distribution of the regression coefficients for each coefficient that measures the outcome (health status) associated with its predictor variables. In a larger sample, the likelihood dominates the prior distribution for regression coefficients and Bayesian hierarchical model used a likelihood-based approach, used priors (prior laboratory and clinical trials data) that provided the assay sensitivities, which through the prior assumptions, made the model identifiable and the integration of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates the posterior distributions, avoided missing data and complex outcome measurements.\nResults/limitations\nThree case studies: pneumonia etiology in children, prostate cancer, and mental disorders chosen for model development, identified low-risk patient population, reduced the risk of overtreatment, complications, adverse effects, and financial burden for patients (Disease Reclassification). Prostate cancer software was then implemented within the JHM HER.\nLimitation:\nModels were entirely parametric, and extensions to nonparametric or more flexible parametric models were recommended to improve approaches for neuroimage or genomic data.\nApplications:\n\nto scale a tool that addresses a particular unmet need across a larger, more diverse population of patients and clinicians\nuse in autoimmune diseases, sudden cardiac arrest, and diabetes.\nembed a collection of tools to acquire and use the most relevant information, agnostic to its level of measurement, to improve population and individual health decisions that cause better outcomes at more affordable costs. @Zeger2020\n\n\nBayesian Inference (parametric vs non-parametric)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe authors calculated the posterior probability of disease diagnosis and applied Bayesian inference to develop three modules comparing parametric (with a fixed set of parameters) and nonparametric distributions (which do not make a priori assumptions) by analyzing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset from two separate diagnostic tests on both diseased and non-diseased populations.\nWhy is it important?\nMedical diagnosis, treatment, and management decisions are crucial, and conventional methods for diagnosis using clinical criteria and fixed numerical thresholds limit the capture of other information related to the intricate relationship between diagnostic tests and the varying prevalence of diseases. The probability distributions associated with quantitative diagnostic test outcomes often demonstrate some overlap between the diseased and nondiseased groups. The dichotomous method fails to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of disease presentations across diverse populations. The applicability of the normal distribution (conventional method) is critiqued, especially in dealing with clinical measurands having skewness, bimodality, or multimodality.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: The Authors developed models employing Bayesian inference (Bayesian diagnostic approach) to calculate the posterior probability of @Liu2013"

BMC Med Inform Decis Mak 25, 123 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-025-02955-3\nProblem: Data curation is challenging as clinical data are heterogeneous in multiple ways. Biomarkers are recorded for different reasons. If missing data imputation is performed, it raises another decision point on whether to impute the continuous or the transformed categorical data.\nAim: Estimating predictive risk factors for disease outcomes with explainable statistical models is desirable for clinical use and decision making. The author provide a guide for modern Bayesian approaches for joint risk factor analysis and variable selection.\nStudy design: Retrospective observational cohort design, lab data linked to the patient data for laboratory markers and clinical outcomes from three hospitals in the Southwest region of England, UK on adults admitted between March to October 2020 and tested positive for SARS CoV-2 by PCR.\nMethod: Analyze range of laboratory blood marker values, Develop cross-validated logistic regression prediction models using the candidate biomarkers, highlighting biomarkers worthy of future research. Employed selection techniques, comparing LASSO frequentist method and Projective Prediction approach on Bayesian logistic regression models with horseshoe priors to illustrate the process of creating a reduced model. They considered models deliver good prediction performance with a small amount of biomarker data.\nVairables (1) Predictors: Includes a variety of clinical severity indices, lab biomarkers (microbiological, immunological, haematological and biochemistry) as parameters used as predictive variables in the regression models.\n\nOutcome: The primary prediction outcome was death or transfer to the ICU.\n\nData management: Continuous biomarkers were trannsfromed into categorical variables (reference ranges for clinical use).\nStaistical calcukation: Analytics carried out using the R statistical language using- Standard logistic regression analyses used the R Stats GLM package (v4.4.1); LASSO analyses, GLMnet (v4.1.8); and for Bayesian analyses, BRMS (v2.22.0) and ProjPred (v2.8.0).\nBefore running full regression models, the independent contribution of individual biomarkers were examined in the training dataset predicting ICU entry or death via standard logistic regressions and Bayesian logistic regressions with either a flat (aka uniform) or horseshoe prior and calculated p-values and odds ratios for each biomarker.\nPer biomarker, patients with and without the outcome were separated and then these groups were shuffled and split into 5 equal subgroups. These groups were then paired at random, to ensure training and test datasets have the same proportion of patients with a severe outcome as in full the sample for that biomarker. This was to improve the chance of convergence for biomarkers with high data missingness and only complete cases of training data available for each biomarker were considered for the study.\nEach individual biomarker model including age and gender (except univariate age and gender models) were compared against a standard model including only age and gender. Regressions were fit using all associated dummy variables for a given biomarker (e.g. ‘Mild’, ‘Moderate’, ‘Severe’) using ‘Normal’ as the reference.\nAnalysis using all valid biomarker data: After individual biomarker evaluation, logistic regression models considering all valid biomarkers (Prediction using individual variables section) and demographic variables were fit to the data and the predictions were tested via internal and external validation using the stratified cross-validation procedures.\nAnalysis using reduced variable models: Considering that eben though a model using all biomarker data may have strong predictive power, but clinically a strong prediction with the least amount of biomarkers might save on time, money and other resources, they used LASSO and Bayesian Projective Prediction methodologies to choose reduced variable models to predict COVID-19 severe outcomes.\nTo estimate variability in model performance and allow comparison between models, we compute inter-quantile AUC difference ranges using 5-fold 20-repeat cross-validation of models\nReduced variable models: LASSO and projective prediction performed for creation of reduced models with fewer biomarkers.\nModel performance evaluation and dissemination They chose to peform cross-validated estimates of AUC, sensitivity, and specificity and the Inter-quartile intervals over these measures.\nRecommendations: Categorization is worth critical consideration in model planning Reduced number of variables Imputation Bayesian approaches should include that coefficients estimated via Bayes should on average deliver better predictive performance than standard GLM"

    "text": "Aims\nThe present study employs Bayesian logistic regression to predict diabetes status and examine the relationships between diabetes and key predictors, including body mass index (BMI), age (≥20 years), sex, and race. Using retrospective data from the 2013–2014 NHANES survey, the analysis accounts for the study’s complex sampling design, which involves stratification, clustering, and the oversampling of specific subpopulations rather than simple random sampling. The Bayesian framework is applied to address common analytical challenges such as missing data, complete case bias, and data separation, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of inference compared to traditional logistic regression methods."

    "text": "Bayesian Logistic Regression\nThe Bayesian framework integrates prior knowledge with observed data to generate posterior distributions, allowing parameters to be interpreted directly in probabilistic terms.\nUnlike traditional frequentist approaches that yield single-point estimates and p-values, Bayesian methods represent parameters as random variables with full probability distributions.\nThis provides greater flexibility, incorporates parameter uncertainty, and produces credible intervals that directly quantify the probability that a parameter lies within a given range."

After incorporating the observed evidence, the priors are updated through Bayes’ theorem (Leeuw and Klugkist 2012; Klauenberg et al. 2015):\n\\[\n\\text{Posterior} \\propto \\text{Likelihood} \\times \\text{Prior}\n\\]\n\nLikelihood: represents the probability of the observed data given the model parameters—it captures how well different parameter values explain the data.\nPrior: expresses beliefs or existing information about the parameters before observing the data.\nPosterior: combines both, representing the updated distribution of parameter values after accounting for the data.\n\nThis formulation allows uncertainty to propagate naturally through the model, producing posterior distributions for each coefficient that can be directly interpreted as probabilities."

    "text": "Data Preparation\nThis study used publicly available 2013–2014 NHANES data published by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 2014). Three component files were utilized: DEMO_H (demographics), BMX_H (body measures), and DIQ_H (diabetes questionnaire). Each file was imported in .XPT format using the haven package in R, and merged using the unique participant identifier SEQN to create a single adult analytic dataset (age ≥ 20 years).\nAll variables were coerced to consistent numeric or factor types prior to merging to ensure atomic columns suitable for survey-weighted analysis and modeling. The use of SEQN preserved respondent integrity across datasets and ensured accurate record linkage. This preprocessing step standardized variable formats and minimized inconsistencies between files.\nData wrangling, cleaning, and merging were performed in R using a combination of base functions and tidyverse packages. Bayesian logistic regression modeling was later implemented using the brms interface to Stan, allowing probabilistic inference within a reproducible workflow that accommodated the NHANES complex survey design and missing data considerations.\n\nData Import and Merging\n\n\nCode\nmerged_data &lt;- readRDS(\"data/merged_2013_2014.rds\")\n\nmerged_n &lt;- nrow(merged_data)\n\n\nThe merged dataset contains 10,175 participants.

These variables were applied to adjust for unequal probabilities of selection, nonresponse, and oversampling, ensuring valid standard errors, unbiased prevalence estimates, and generalizable population-level inference.\nA survey-weighted logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between diabetes status (diabetes_dx, binary outcome) and key predictors: body mass index (bmi), age (age), sex (sex), and race/ethnicity (race). Diabetes was defined using DIQ010 (“Doctor told you have diabetes”) and coded as 0/1, with DIQ050 (insulin use) excluded to avoid treatment-related confounding.\nCovariates included:\n- age (continuous; centered as age_c, categorized 20–80 years)\n- bmi (continuous; centered as bmi_c, and categorized by BMI class bmi_cat)\n- sex (male, female)\n- race (four ethnicity levels: White, Black, Hispanic, Other)\nThis approach accounts for NHANES’ complex sampling design, producing unbiased parameter estimates and valid inference for U.S. adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWeighting\nUsed the survey package to calculate weighted means for key variables (e.g., age and diabetes status) and to estimate design effects and effective sample size for the complex survey design.\n\n\nStandardization\nCentered and standardized BMI and age (bmi_c, age_c) for use in regression models.\n\n\nAge Categorization\nNot implemented in the analytic dataset (continuous age retained). Reference retained for potential descriptive grouping (20–&lt;30, 30–&lt;40, 40–&lt;50, 50–&lt;60, 60–&lt;70, 70–80).\n\n\nBMI Categorization\nRecoded as: &lt;18.5 (Underweight), 18.5–&lt;25 (Normal), 25–&lt;30 (Overweight), 30–&lt;35 (Obesity I), 35–&lt;40 (Obesity II), ≥40 (Obesity III).\n\n\nEthnicity Recoding\nRIDRETH1 recoded as: 1 = Mexican American, 2 = Other Hispanic, 3 = Non-Hispanic White, 4 = Non-Hispanic Black, 5 = Other/Multi; then NH White set as the reference level (five analytical levels retained).\n\n\nSpecial Codes\nTransformed nonresponse codes (e.g., 3, 7, 9) to NA. These missing codes were evaluated for potential nonrandom patterns (MAR/MNAR).\n\n\nMissing Data\nRetained and visualized missing values (primarily in BMI and diabetes status) to assess their pattern and informativeness before multiple imputation.\n\n\nFinal Dataset\nCreated the cleaned analytic dataset (adult) using Non-Hispanic White and Male as reference groups for modeling, preserving NHANES survey design variables (WTMEC2YR, SDMVPSU, SDMVSTRA).\n\n\n\n\n\nAdult Cohort Definition\n\n\nCode\n# NHANES survey design object for the adult analytic cohort\n\nnhanes_design_adult &lt;- survey::svydesign(\nid      = ~SDMVPSU,\nstrata  = ~SDMVSTRA,\nweights = ~WTMEC2YR,\nnest    = TRUE,\ndata    = adult\n)\n\n# Quick weighted checks\n\nsurvey::svymean(~age, nhanes_design_adult, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n      mean     SE\nage 47.496 0.3805\n\n\nCode\nsurvey::svymean(~diabetes_dx, nhanes_design_adult, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n                mean     SE\ndiabetes_dx 0.089016 0.0048\n\n\nCode\n# Design effect and effective sample size for `diabetes_dx`\n\nv_hat &lt;- as.numeric(survey::svyvar(~diabetes_dx, nhanes_design_adult, na.rm = TRUE))\np_hat &lt;- mean(adult$diabetes_dx, na.rm = TRUE)\nn_obs &lt;- nrow(adult)\nv_srs &lt;- p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n_obs\ndeff  &lt;- v_hat / v_srs\n\nn_total &lt;- sum(weights(nhanes_design_adult), na.rm = TRUE)\ness     &lt;- as.numeric(n_total / deff)\n\ncat(\"Design effect for diabetes_dx:\", round(deff, 2), \"\\n\")\n\n\nDesign effect for diabetes_dx: 4759.91 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Effective sample size for diabetes_dx:\", round(ess), \"\\n\")\n\n\nEffective sample size for diabetes_dx: 48142 \n\n\nDescriptive statistics for continuous and categorical variables are presented below.\n\n\nCode\n# Keep only analytic variables for Table 1\ntbl1_dat &lt;- adult %&gt;%\n  transmute(\n    age,\n    bmi,\n    bmi_cat,\n    sex,\n    race,\n    diabetes_dx = factor(diabetes_dx, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n  )\n\n# Continuous summaries: N, missing, mean, sd, min, max\ncont_vars &lt;- c(\"age\", \"bmi\")\n\ncont_sum &lt;- tbl1_dat %&gt;%\n  select(all_of(cont_vars)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"value\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Variable) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    N       = sum(!is.na(value)),\n    Missing = sum(is.na(value)),\n    Mean    = round(mean(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n    SD      = round(sd(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n    Min     = round(min(value, na.rm = TRUE), 1),\n    Max     = round(max(value, na.rm = TRUE), 1),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Categorical summaries: counts and percents\ncat_vars &lt;- c(\"sex\", \"race\", \"diabetes_dx\", \"bmi_cat\")\n\ncat_sum &lt;- tbl1_dat %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(all_of(cat_vars),\n                ~ forcats::fct_explicit_na(as.factor(.x), na_level = \"(Missing)\"))) %&gt;%\n  select(all_of(cat_vars)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"Level\") %&gt;%\n  count(Variable, Level, name = \"n\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Variable) %&gt;%\n  mutate(pct = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  arrange(Variable, desc(n))\n\n# Render tables\nkable(cont_sum,\n      caption = \"Table 1a.

Mean age and BMI values indicate an adult cohort spanning a wide range of body composition, while categorical summaries confirm balanced sex representation and sufficient sample sizes across race/ethnicity categories. These variables were standardized and used as predictors in all modeling frameworks (analytic cohort N = 5,769 adults ≥ 20 years).\nThe analytic adult cohort (N = 5,769) includes standardized variables for age and BMI (age_c, bmi_c), categorical indicators for sex and race/ethnicity (race), and a binary doctor-diagnosed diabetes variable (diabetes_dx). This is a clean dataset with all NAs removed.\n\n\nCode\n# Visual structure and type overview\nplot_intro(adult, title = \"Adult Dataset: Variable Types and Completeness\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visual overview indicates that 75% of variables are continuous and 25% are categorical, with no completely missing columns. Approximately 92.7% of rows are fully complete, and only 1.3% of observations contain missing values, suggesting minimal data loss prior to imputation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing Data Summary\n\n\nCode\n# Visualize missing data pattern\nplot_missing(adult, title = \"Missing Data Pattern (Adult Dataset)\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing data were minimal across analytic variables. BMI-related fields (bmi, bmi_c, bmi_cat) showed ~4.3% missingness, and diabetes_dx showed ~3.1%. All demographic and survey design variables were complete, indicating that missingness was limited to health-related measures and appropriate for multiple imputation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Summarize missingness for key analysis variables\n\nmiss_tbl &lt;- tibble::tibble(\nVariable    = c(\"bmi\", \"diabetes_dx\"),\nMissing_n   = c(sum(is.na(adult_eda$bmi)), sum(is.na(adult_eda$diabetes_dx))),\nMissing_pct = round(c(mean(is.na(adult_eda$bmi)), mean(is.na(adult_eda$diabetes_dx))) * 100, 1)\n)\n\nknitr::kable(\nmiss_tbl,\ncaption = \"Missingness for Key Analysis Variables.\"\n)\n\n\n\nMissingness for Key Analysis Variables.\n\n\nVariable\nMissing_n\nMissing_pct\n\n\n\n\nbmi\n249\n4.3\n\n\ndiabetes_dx\n177\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall missingness was low (~7.3%). Gaps were concentrated in bmi (n = 249) and diabetes_dx (n = 177), while demographic and design variables were complete. This limited pattern of missingness is consistent with a Missing At Random (MAR) mechanism and likely reflects reduced participation in the physical examination component among certain adults.\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nFollowing the missing data assessment, exploratory analyses were conducted to describe the adult analytic cohort and visualize distributions across key demographic and health variables. The goal was to examine univariate patterns and bivariate relationships relevant to diabetes prevalence prior to modeling.\nThe adult analytic cohort was broadly representative of the U.S. population, with a majority identifying as Non-Hispanic White. Age and BMI distributions were right-skewed, with most participants classified as overweight or obese. Visual exploration revealed a clear positive association between age, BMI, and diabetes prevalence. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants exhibited higher diabetes prevalence compared with Non-Hispanic Whites.\nApproximately 25% of variables were categorical (e.g., sex, race, diabetes_dx) and 75% were continuous (e.g., age, bmi, age_c, bmi_c), indicating that the dataset primarily comprised measured numeric values. About 93% of observations contained complete information across all predictors and outcomes, reflecting high data quality.\nAdult age ranged from 20 to 80 years, with peak representation between 30 and 50 years and a slight right skew toward older ages. BMI was concentrated in the overweight and obese ranges, and Female participants were slightly overrepresented relative to Male participants.\n\n\nCode\n# Age distribution (analytic adult)\nggplot(adult, aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Age (≥20 years)\", x = \"Age (years)\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of age among adults aged ≥20 years.

Males show significantly lower odds of diabetes than females, consistent with established sex differences in metabolic outcomes. Racial and ethnic disparities are evident, with Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Black, and Other/Multi-racial adults all showing significantly higher odds of diabetes compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. All predictors were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), indicating robust associations across demographic and health characteristics.\n\n\n\nMultiple Imputation by Chained Equations\nMultiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) was implemented as a principled approach for handling missing data (Stef van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011; S. van Buuren 2012). MICE iteratively imputes each incomplete variable using regression models based on other variables in the dataset, generating multiple completed datasets that incorporate uncertainty from the imputation process. Estimates are subsequently pooled across imputations using Rubin’s rules to obtain final parameter estimates and confidence intervals.\nAs an alternative to full Bayesian joint modeling, MICE provides an efficient and flexible framework for managing missing data through chained regression equations. For large sample sizes (n ≥ 400), even with substantial missingness (up to 75%) in a single variable, MICE remains robust to non-normality—such as skewed, multimodal, or heavy-tailed distributions—without materially affecting mean structure estimation performance (S. van Buuren 2012).\nIn this study, continuous variables were imputed using regression-based methods: age via normal linear regression (norm) and BMI via predictive mean matching (pmm) to better preserve the empirical BMI distribution. Categorical variables (sex and race) were imputed using logistic and polytomous regression models, respectively. Diabetes status (diabetes_dx) was treated as an outcome variable and was not imputed. Twenty imputations were generated to minimize Monte Carlo error and ensure stable variance estimation.\n\nConvergence and Data Stability\nThe chained equation process showed stable convergence across iterations, confirming reliable estimation of missing BMI (and, where present, age) values. After applying MICE, the final imputed dataset included n = 5,592 adults with all key predictors completed.\n\n\nCode\nadult_imp1 &lt;- mice::complete(imp, 1) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    age_c  = as.numeric(scale(age)),\n    bmi_c  = as.numeric(scale(bmi)),\n    wt_norm = WTMEC2YR / mean(WTMEC2YR, na.rm = TRUE),\n    race = forcats::fct_relevel(race, \"NH White\"),\n    sex  = forcats::fct_relevel(sex,  \"Male\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(\n    !is.na(diabetes_dx),\n    !is.na(age_c),\n    !is.na(bmi_c),\n    !is.na(sex),\n    !is.na(race)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\nstr(adult_imp1)\n\n\n'data.frame':   5592 obs. of  11 variables:\n $ diabetes_dx: num  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ age        : num  69 54 72 73 56 61 42 56 65 26 ...\n $ bmi        : num  26.7 28.6 28.9 19.7 41.7 35.7 23.6 26.5 22 20.3 ...\n $ sex        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"Male\",\"Female\": 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ...\n $ race       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"NH White\",\"Mexican American\",..: 4 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 1 ...\n $ WTMEC2YR   : num  13481 24472 57193 65542 25345 ...\n $ SDMVPSU    : num  1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 ...\n $ SDMVSTRA   : num  112 108 109 116 111 114 106 112 112 113 ...\n $ age_c      : num  1.132 0.278 1.303 1.36 0.392 ...\n $ bmi_c      : num  -0.3332 -0.0676 -0.0256 -1.3118 1.7639 ...\n $ wt_norm    : num  0.339 0.616 1.44 1.65 0.638 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayesian Logistic Regression\nBayesian logistic regression was used to quantify parameter uncertainty and compare posterior estimates with the survey-weighted model.

In contrast, weaker predictors such as sex displayed overlapping distributions, indicating that inference for those parameters was more influenced by prior uncertainty than by the observed data.

    "text": "Discussion and Limitations\n\nInterpretation\nThe Bayesian logistic regression framework produced results that were highly consistent with the survey-weighted design-based model. Age and BMI remained the most influential predictors of doctor-diagnosed diabetes, each showing a strong and positive association with diabetes risk.\nUnlike classical maximum likelihood estimation, the Bayesian approach directly quantified uncertainty through posterior distributions, offering richer interpretability and more transparent probability statements. The alignment between Bayesian and design-based estimates supports the robustness of these associations and highlights the practicality of Bayesian modeling for complex, weighted population data.\nPosterior predictive checks confirmed that simulated diabetes prevalence closely matched the observed NHANES estimate, supporting good model calibration. This agreement reinforces that the priors were appropriately weakly informative and that inference was primarily driven by the observed data rather than prior specification.\nOverall, this study demonstrates that Bayesian inference complements traditional epidemiologic methods by maintaining interpretability while enhancing stability and explicitly quantifying uncertainty in complex survey data.\n\n\nLimitations\nWhile this analysis highlights the strengths of Bayesian logistic regression for epidemiologic modeling, several limitations should be acknowledged.\nFirst, the Bayesian model used a single imputed dataset rather than jointly modeling imputation uncertainty, which may lead to a modest understatement of total variance.\nSecond, NHANES examination weights were normalized and treated as importance weights. This approach approximates—but does not fully replicate—design-based inference and may slightly affect standard error estimation.\nThird, the weakly informative priors \\(N(0, 2.5)\\) for slopes and Student-t(3, 0, 10) for the intercept were not empirically tuned. Alternative prior choices could marginally shift posterior intervals or reduce shrinkage.\nFourth, although convergence diagnostics (R̂ ≈ 1.00, large effective sample sizes, and stable posterior predictive checks) indicated good model performance, results are conditional on the 2013–2014 NHANES cycle and may not generalize to later survey waves or longitudinal applications.\nFinally, the model has not undergone external validation or formal sensitivity analyses. The participant-level posterior risk estimates presented here are intended for illustration only and should not be used for individual prediction or clinical decision-making. Before external deployment or use in other settings, the model would require validation in independent datasets and sensitivity analyses to evaluate robustness to both modeling assumptions and prior specifications.\n\nTargeted Therapy\nThe Bayesian diabetes prediction project highlights the translational potential of Bayesian modeling in clinical decision-making and public health strategy.\nBy incorporating patient-level predictors such as age, BMI, sex, and race to estimate diabetes probability, the model shifts from descriptive statistics toward individualized risk prediction.\nThe translational value lies in converting these probabilistic outputs into actionable thresholds—for example, identifying the BMI or age at which predicted diabetes risk exceeds a clinically meaningful level (e.g., 30%).\nThese insights can support early screening, personalized lifestyle recommendations, and targeted prevention programs for higher-risk populations.\nThis approach reflects precision public health by bridging data science and clinical judgment to create tailored, evidence-based strategies that may improve diabetes prevention and management outcomes.\nWhat changes in modifiable predictors would lower diabetes risk?\n\n\nTranslational Research Implications\n\nThe model can be used to inform prevention and intervention strategies.\nBMI is the only modifiable predictor in the current model.\nChanges in BMI (via behavior or lifestyle interventions) can be explored to achieve a lower predicted risk.\nNon-modifiable predictors (e.g., sex and race) are held constant.\nThe modifiable predictor (BMI) is varied until the model reaches the desired probability threshold."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Bayesian and survey-weighted logistic regression frameworks both identified consistent predictors of diabetes risk among U.S. adults: advancing age, higher BMI, sex (lower odds for females), and non-White race/ethnicity. These convergent findings reinforce the robustness of core risk factors and the validity of the analytic approach across modeling paradigms.\nThe Bayesian model produced estimates nearly identical in direction and magnitude to the frequentist results while offering richer uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions, credible intervals, and posterior predictive checks. Diagnostics (R̂ ≈ 1.00, large effective sample sizes, and Bayesian R² ≈ 0.13) confirmed model convergence and good fit, demonstrating that weakly informative priors effectively regularized estimation without distorting inference.\nCollectively, these results underscore the value of Bayesian inference in epidemiologic research involving complex survey data. By integrating prior information and leveraging MCMC sampling to approximate the full posterior distribution, Bayesian models enhance transparency, interpretability, and reproducibility. Future extensions could incorporate hierarchical priors, combine multiple NHANES cycles, or explore Bayesian model averaging to better capture population heterogeneity, temporal trends, and evolving diabetes risk patterns."

While deep learning is powerful, it typically lacks mechanisms for representing uncertainty or handling limited data in a principled way. Bayesian techniques address these gaps by incorporating uncertainty, prior knowledge, and probabilistic reasoning—making models potentially safer, more trustworthy, and interpretable in clinical settings.\nMethods\n- Conduct a literature survey of recent work combining Bayesian methods with deep learning in healthcare.\n- Categorize approaches such as variational inference, Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble methods, Gaussian processes, and Bayesian neural networks.\n- Map these methods to healthcare tasks like diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning.\n- Evaluate strengths/weaknesses in terms of data availability, computational costs, interpretability, uncertainty calibration, and privacy.\nResults & Limitations\n- Results: BDL has shown success in disease classification, survival analysis, medical image segmentation, and predictive modeling. It often improves uncertainty quantification, may improve generalization, and provides clinicians with added information (e.g., confidence in predictions).\n- Limitations: High computational demands, scalability issues, difficulty specifying priors, and interpretability challenges remain. Many studies are proof-of-concept and lack validation in real-world clinical environments. Regulatory, privacy, and workflow integration concerns also limit deployment."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nBayesian Hierarchical Model (Disease reclassification and prediction)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe authors develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for multivariate longitudinal data to predict health status, trajectories, and intervention effects at the individual level in the PCORI mission to address questions about health status from patients and clinicians.\nWhy is it important?\nHealthcare data (DNA sequences, functional images of the brain, patient-reported outcomes, and electronic health records with patients’ sequences of health measurements, diagnoses, and treatments) are complex, and the standard approaches are not adequate for clinical data analysis. Electronic health records (EHRs) could improve diagnostic accuracy and predict treatment effects. Visualizations of characteristics of posterior distributions can be immediately understood by clinicians and patients as relevant to their decision. Combining prior knowledge and patient data with evidence could predict the patient’s health status, trajectory, and/or likely benefits of interventions.\nHow is it solved?\nMethod: The authors applied Bayesian hierarchical regression for multivariate longitudinal patient data using open-source R-packages and developed 2 levels—time within person and persons within a population\nThe model combined exogenous (eg, age, clinical history) factors and endogenous (eg, current treatment) variables on the individual’s multivariate health measurements and the effects of health measurements at one time on subsequent interventions.\nThe model produced an estimate of the posterior distribution for each value of the predictor variable and an estimate of the marginal distribution of the regression coefficients for each coefficient that measures the outcome (health status) associated with its predictor variables. In a larger sample, the likelihood dominates the prior distribution for regression coefficients and Bayesian hierarchical model used a likelihood-based approach, used priors (prior laboratory and clinical trials data) that provided the assay sensitivities, which through the prior assumptions, made the model identifiable and the integration of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates the posterior distributions, avoided missing data and complex outcome measurements.\nResults\nThree case studies: pneumonia etiology in children, prostate cancer, and mental disorders chosen for model development, identified low-risk patient population, reduced the risk of overtreatment, complications, adverse effects, and financial burden for patients (Disease Reclassification). Prostate cancer software was then implemented within the JHM HER.\nLimitation:\nModels were entirely parametric, and extensions to nonparametric or more flexible parametric models were recommended to improve approaches for neuroimage or genomic data.\nneuroimage or genomic data.\nApplications:\n\nto scale a tool that addresses a particular unmet need across a larger, more diverse population of patients and clinicians\nuse in autoimmune diseases, sudden cardiac arrest, and diabetes.\nembed a collection of tools to acquire and use the most relevant information, agnostic to its level of measurement, to improve population and individual health decisions that cause better outcomes at more affordable costs. @Zeger2020\n\n\nBayesian Inference (parametric vs non-parametric)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe authors calculated the posterior probability of disease diagnosis and applied Bayesian inference to develop three modules comparing parametric (with a fixed set of parameters) and nonparametric distributions (which do not make a priori assumptions) by analyzing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset from two separate diagnostic tests on both diseased and non-diseased populations.\nWhy is it important?\nMedical diagnosis, treatment, and management decisions are crucial, and conventional methods for diagnosis using clinical criteria and fixed numerical thresholds limit the capture of other information related to the intricate relationship between diagnostic tests and the varying prevalence of diseases. The probability distributions associated with quantitative diagnostic test outcomes often demonstrate some overlap between the diseased and nondiseased groups. The dichotomous method fails to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of disease presentations across diverse populations. The applicability of the normal distribution (conventional method) is critiqued, especially in dealing with clinical measurands having skewness, bimodality, or multimodality.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: The Authors developed models employing Bayesian inference (Bayesian diagnostic approach) to calculate the posterior probability of disease diagnosis in the Wolfram Language and integrated prior probabilities of disease with distributions of diagnostic measurands in both diseased and nondiseased populations. The approach enabled the evaluation of combined data from multiple diagnostic tests and improved the diagnostic accuracy, precision and adaptability, The model showed flexibility, adaptability, and versatility in the diagnostic.\nResults\nNonparametric Bayesian models tend to fit data distributions better, especially given limited existing literature, and are more robust in capturing complex data patterns.\nThese models produce multimodal probability patterns for disease, unlike the bimodal, double-sigmoidal curves seen with parametric models.\nLimitations\n\nReliance on parametric models: A need to extend to nonparametric or more flexible parametric models for medical data.\nLimited scholarly publications and over-dependence on prior probabilities increase uncertainties, resulting in broader confidence intervals for posterior probabilities. Systemic bias (unrepresentative datasets) compromises the accuracy of Bayesian calculations. For Incomplete datasets, Bayesian methods combined with other statistical and computational techniques could enhance diagnostic capabilities.\nThe foundational data is crucial to compare new diagnostic measurements. Absence of normative data compromises the reliability and validity of Bayesian diagnostic methods. @Chatzimichail2023\n\n\nBayesian model stages, development and advantages, and temporal models\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\n\nThe study describes the stages of Bayesian analysis, specifying the importance of the priors, data modeling, inferences, model checking and refinement, selecting a proper sampling technique from a posterior distribution, variational inferences, variable selection and its application across various research fields. The study proposes strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist and outlining the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence in the future.\nWhy is it important?\nBayesian statistics is suitable for quantitative researchers accross different fields who have at least some knowledge of regression modelling.\nHow is it solved?\nExamples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields (social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine) and the advantages and disadvantages of the Bayesian model are provided here, and overview of the current and future use of Bayesian statistics.\nThe study mention priors into three categories (informative, weakly informative and diffuse) based on the degree of (un)certainty (hyperparameters) surrounding the population parameter. The prior distribution is as - N( μ0 , σ^ 20) where a larger variance represents a greater amount of uncertainty surrounding.\nPrior elicitation (experts, generic expert, data-based, sample data using maximum likelihood or sample statistics, etc) construct a prior distribution.\nPrior sensitivity analysis of the likelihood helps examine different forms of the model, assesses how the priors and the likelihood align and have an impact on posterior estimates, reflecting variations not captured by the prior or the likelihood alone.\nPrior estimation allows data-informed shrinkage, enacts regularization or influence algorithms towards a likely high-density region, and improves estimation efficiency.\nKnowing the exact probabilistic specification of the priors for a complex model with smaller sample sizes is important. A small sample conveys less information compared to the priors that quantify the strength of support the observed data lends to possible value(s) for the unknown parameter(s).\nFrequentists do not consider the probability of the unknown parameters as useful, and they are considered to be fixed; the likelihood is the conditional probability distribution p(y|θ) of the data (y), given fixed parameters (θ). In Bayesian inference, unknown parameters (random variables) have varied values, while the (observed) data have fixed values, and the likelihood is a function of θ for the fixed data y.\nTherefore, the likelihood function summarizes a statistical model that stochastically generates a range of possible values for θ and the observed data y. With priors and the likelihood of the observed data, the resulting posterior distribution provides an estimate of the unknown parameters, capturing the primary factors and improving our understanding. Monte Carlo technique provides integrals of sampled values from a given distribution through computer simulations. The packages BRMS and Blavaan in R are used for the probabilistic programming language Stan.\nVariable selection after checking correlations among the variables in the model (Eg: gene-to-gene interaction) aids in the prediction of genes in biomedical research (genome-wide association studies).\nSpatial and temporal variability are factored in Bayesian general linear models. A posterior distribution can simulate new data conditional on this distribution, assess, and provide valid predictions to be used for extrapolating to future events.\nResults\nThe Bayesian approach analyzes large-scale cancer genomic data, identifies novel molecular changes in cancer initiation and progression, the interactions between mutated genes and captured mutational signatures, highlighting key genetic interactions components, allowing genomic-based patient stratification both in clinical trials, in the personalized use of therapeutics, and in understanding cancer and its evolutionary processes.\nLimitations:\n\nIn temporal models, posterior inference challenges are inherent in the spatial and/or temporal dependencies (autocorrelation of parameters over time). @VandeSchoot2021\n\n\nBayesian Normal linear regression\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe author provides guidance on Bayesian inference by performing Bayesian Normal linear regression in metrology to calibrate instruments and to evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons in determining fundamental constants.\nWhy is it important?\nThe measurement errors are assumed to be additive, independent, and identically distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance σ2, which is usually unknown.\nRegression is used to calibrate instruments, evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons, or determine fundamental constants, but the regression model cannot be uniquely formulated as a measurement function. Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements are not applicable directly.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: Bayesian inference has the advantage of accounting for additional a priori information, which robustifies the analyses.\nThree steps (prior elicitation, posterior calculation, and robustness to prior uncertainty and model adequacy) and model assumptions are critical to Bayesian inference.\nIn Bayesian inference, all unknowns—observables (data) as well as unobservables (parameters and auxiliary variables) are considered to be random, are assigned probability distributions to summarize the available information, and to update prior knowledge about the unobservables with information about them contained in the data. The prior distribution and likelihood function provided by simple graphical displays, sensitivity analyses, or model checking enhance the elicitation and interpretation process.\nFor Normal linear regression problems\n(1) a family of prior distributions for θ and σ2 is (Normal inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution to a posterior from the same family of (NIG) distributions or\n(2) alternative families of prior distributions (hierarchical priors) assign an additional layer of distributions to uncertain prior parameters or non-para- metric priors.\nThe NIG prior with known variance σ2 of observations is a conjugate prior distribution. Vague or non-informative prior distributions can be derived from the NIG prior.\nBayesian inference is influenced by\n\nthe uncertainty in the transformation of prior knowledge to prior distributions\nthe assumptions of the statistical model\nthe mistakes in data acquisition\n\nResults\nThe knowledge from related previous experiments (Normal inverse Gamma distributions) allow for analytic posterior calculations of many quantities of interest. @Klauenberg2015\n\nBayesian linear regression and priors (exchangeable and unexchangeable)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe study developed a test of a formal method for augmenting data in linear regression analyses, by incorporating both exchangeable and unexchangeable information on regression coefficients (and standard errors) of previous studies.\nWhy is it important?\nThe frequent combination of multiple testing has relatively low statistical power, which is problematic in null-hypothesis significance testing. Linear regression analyses do not account for the published results and summary statistics from similar previous studies. Ignoring information on parameters from previous studies (relevant and readily available), affects the stability and precision of the parameter estimates and results in lower values than they could have been, resulting in conclusions that are less certain and are affected by sampling variation.\nMultiple linear regression with separate significance tests for all regression coefficients, and with the modest sample sizes, different studies find different sets of statistically significant predictors, and addressing the issue on larger samples is practically unrealistic.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: Bayesian linear regression accommodates prior knowledge, overcoming the absence of formal studies, handles the issues of increasing the sample size, and augments the data of a new study with previous results (regression coefficients and standard errors) from similar studies.\nThe authors used Bayesian linear regression to solve the issue of the univariate case analysis by combining evidence of specific predictors from different linear regression analyses (as in meta-analysis) and found it a better method to resolve the issue of simultaneously combining multiple regression parameters per study, which ignored the relationship between the regression coefficients. Includes summary statistics from previous studies, Bayesian linear regression provided a more acceptable solution when data from previous studies were not (realistically) obtainable.\nModels in the study as categorized the model into - (1) Exchangable - when the current data and previous studies have the same set of predictors. (2) Unexchangable – when the predictors were different in the two.\nTo yield the posterior density that reflects the updated knowledge about the model parameters after having observed the data, the steps to Bayesian linear regression steps are mentioned -\n(1) To calculate the probability density function for the data given the unknown model parameters;\n(2) Taken as a function of those model parameters, the likelihood function is the second part of the prior density function of the model parameters. It quantifies what is assumed to be known about the model parameters before observing the data. The study applied the Standard multiple linear regression model, and with the integration of the prior, provided the joint posterior density using the Gibbs sampler. An Ordinary Least Squares linear regression was then applied to each of these samples to obtain the estimated regression coefficients B and the corresponding standard errors.\n(3) A hierarchical model version was developed in analyzing parameters where studies are not exchangeable.\nResults\nIncorporating priors from previous studies in a linear regression on new data yielded a significantly better parameter estimate with an adequate approximation.\nThe gains in comparison to using just the new data, and the large effects were obtained when the data from previous studies were available, resulting in encouraging performance.\nPerformance of the two versions (exchangeable and unexchangeable) of the replication model was consistently superior to using current data alone.\nThe model developed in the article offers the possibility of obtaining significantly better parameter estimates in a linear regression setting without needing to expend a prohibitive amount of time and energy to obtain data from the previous studies.\nHierarchical version (unexchangeable) of the model offers the advantage of being able to address questions about differences between studies and thus allows for explicit testing of the exchangeability assumption.\nLimitations:\n\nAll studies need to have the same set of predictors.\nThe issue of predictor variables that are correlated. @DeLeeuw2012a\n\n\nBayesian logistic regression (Sequential clinical reasoning approach)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe study aimed to develop models using a longitudinal prospective cohort to predict the risk of incident cardiovascular disease by incorporating demographic features (basic), six metabolic syndrome components (metabolic score), and conventional risk factors (enhanced model). The study participants free of CVD at baseline were followed up over five years, and a Bayesian clinical reasoning model was applied to diagnose new CVD cases.\nWhy is it important?\nEarly diagnosis, prevention, by identifying subjects under the high-risk category for cardiovascular disease (CVD), impacts health interventions.\nLimited availability of molecular information in clinical practice due to being costly and unavailability affects efficient disease diagnosis. To efficiently identify a high-risk population based on the routinely checked biological markers before doing these expensive molecular testsThe requires an alternative approach to analyze data.\nThe Tailored Framingham Risk Score method, for the purpose, is not sufficient because of the differences present in ethnic groups, location, and socio-economic status, as they require the construction of their own models. Heterogeneity (geographic, ethnic group, variations, and different characteristics of social contextual network) often is unobservable and unmeasurable.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: The study evaluated subjects enrolled in a Keelung Community-based Integrated Screening (KCIS) Program, for mass screening (20–79 years) in the Keelung city of Taiwan, who were followed for 5 years to identify incident cancers and chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease).\nThe study classified the risk of having incident CVD cases or death from CVD by dint of available calculated standardized risk score of the MetS components (fasting glucose, blood pressure, HDL-C, triglyceride and waist circumference) together with conventional risk factors (gender, heredity, smoking, alcohol drinking, family history of parent’s CVD and betel quid and other relevant factors).\nEmulating a clinician’s evaluation process, the Bayesian clinical reasoning approach in a sequential manner was applied and three models were developed. The approach considered the normal distribution of regression coefficients of all predictors, allowing for uncertainty of clinical weights. The credible intervals of predicted risk estimates were obtained by averaging out. In the model, the individual risk is elicited by prior speculation (first impression) that is updated by objective observed data (patient’s history and laboratory findings), the regression coefficients for computing risk score were treated as random variable with a certain statistical distribution (e.g. normal distribution) rather than a fixed value (traditional risk prediction model by frequentist). The updated prior distribution with the likelihood of the current data provided a posterior distribution to predict the risk for a specific disease. The sequential approach included -\n\nThe (basic) basic model developed via logistic regression used prior information constructed on gender, age, age2, and time period.\nThe second (classical) model (metabolic score model: MS model) was based on six MetS components.\nThe third (enhanced model) incorporated information on smoking, drinking, betel-quid, and family history of CVD.\n\nResults\nCompared to the basic model and classical model, the enhanced model had better performance. The proposed models predicted CVD incidence at the individual level by incorporating routine information with a sequential Bayesian clinical reasoning approach. Patients’ background significantly contributes to baseline risk. Even with ecological heterogeneity, the regression model adopts individual characteristics and makes individual risk prediction for the CVD incidence.\nLimitations:\n\nWhether the interactions between age, gender, metabolic score, and other risk factors should be included.\nThe use of an enhanced model should be validated through external validation by applying the proposed models to new subjects not included in the training of the model parameters. @Liu2013"

    "text": "Introduction\n\nBayesian Hierarchical Model (Disease reclassification and prediction)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe authors develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for multivariate longitudinal data to predict health status, trajectories, and intervention effects at the individual level in the PCORI mission to address questions about health status from patients and clinicians.\nWhy is it important?\nHealthcare data (DNA sequences, functional images of the brain, patient-reported outcomes, and electronic health records with patients’ sequences of health measurements, diagnoses, and treatments) are complex, and the standard approaches are not adequate for clinical data analysis. Electronic health records (EHRs) could improve diagnostic accuracy and predict treatment effects. Visualizations of characteristics of posterior distributions can be immediately understood by clinicians and patients as relevant to their decision. Combining prior knowledge and patient data with evidence could predict the patient’s health status, trajectory, and/or likely benefits of interventions.\nHow is it solved?\nMethod: The authors applied Bayesian hierarchical regression for multivariate longitudinal patient data using open-source R-packages and developed 2 levels—time within person and persons within a population\nThe model combined exogenous (eg, age, clinical history) factors and endogenous (eg, current treatment) variables on the individual’s multivariate health measurements and the effects of health measurements at one time on subsequent interventions.\nThe model produced an estimate of the posterior distribution for each value of the predictor variable and an estimate of the marginal distribution of the regression coefficients for each coefficient that measures the outcome (health status) associated with its predictor variables. In a larger sample, the likelihood dominates the prior distribution for regression coefficients and Bayesian hierarchical model used a likelihood-based approach, used priors (prior laboratory and clinical trials data) that provided the assay sensitivities, which through the prior assumptions, made the model identifiable and the integration of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates the posterior distributions, avoided missing data and complex outcome measurements.\nResults\nThree case studies: pneumonia etiology in children, prostate cancer, and mental disorders chosen for model development, identified low-risk patient population, reduced the risk of overtreatment, complications, adverse effects, and financial burden for patients (Disease Reclassification). Prostate cancer software was then implemented within the JHM HER.\nLimitation:\nModels were entirely parametric, and extensions to nonparametric or more flexible parametric models were recommended to improve approaches for neuroimage or genomic data.\nneuroimage or genomic data.\nApplications:\n\nto scale a tool that addresses a particular unmet need across a larger, more diverse population of patients and clinicians\nuse in autoimmune diseases, sudden cardiac arrest, and diabetes.\nembed a collection of tools to acquire and use the most relevant information, agnostic to its level of measurement, to improve population and individual health decisions that cause better outcomes at more affordable costs. @Zeger2020\n\n\nBayesian Inference (parametric vs non-parametric)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe authors calculated the posterior probability of disease diagnosis and applied Bayesian inference to develop three modules comparing parametric (with a fixed set of parameters) and nonparametric distributions (which do not make a priori assumptions) by analyzing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset from two separate diagnostic tests on both diseased and non-diseased populations.\nWhy is it important?\nMedical diagnosis, treatment, and management decisions are crucial, and conventional methods for diagnosis using clinical criteria and fixed numerical thresholds limit the capture of other information related to the intricate relationship between diagnostic tests and the varying prevalence of diseases. The probability distributions associated with quantitative diagnostic test outcomes often demonstrate some overlap between the diseased and nondiseased groups. The dichotomous method fails to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of disease presentations across diverse populations. The applicability of the normal distribution (conventional method) is critiqued, especially in dealing with clinical measurands having skewness, bimodality, or multimodality.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: The Authors developed models employing Bayesian inference (Bayesian diagnostic approach) to calculate the posterior probability of disease diagnosis in the Wolfram Language and integrated prior probabilities of disease with distributions of diagnostic measurands in both diseased and nondiseased populations. The approach enabled the evaluation of combined data from multiple diagnostic tests and improved the diagnostic accuracy, precision and adaptability, The model showed flexibility, adaptability, and versatility in the diagnostic.\nResults\nNonparametric Bayesian models tend to fit data distributions better, especially given limited existing literature, and are more robust in capturing complex data patterns.\nThese models produce multimodal probability patterns for disease, unlike the bimodal, double-sigmoidal curves seen with parametric models.\nLimitations\n\nReliance on parametric models: A need to extend to nonparametric or more flexible parametric models for medical data.\nLimited scholarly publications and over-dependence on prior probabilities increase uncertainties, resulting in broader confidence intervals for posterior probabilities. Systemic bias (unrepresentative datasets) compromises the accuracy of Bayesian calculations. For Incomplete datasets, Bayesian methods combined with other statistical and computational techniques could enhance diagnostic capabilities.\nThe foundational data is crucial to compare new diagnostic measurements. Absence of normative data compromises the reliability and validity of Bayesian diagnostic methods. @Chatzimichail2023\n\n\nBayesian model stages, development and advantages, and temporal models\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\n\nThe study describes the stages of Bayesian analysis, specifying the importance of the priors, data modeling, inferences, model checking and refinement, selecting a proper sampling technique from a posterior distribution, variational inferences, variable selection and its application across various research fields. The study proposes strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist and outlining the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence in the future.\nWhy is it important?\nBayesian statistics is suitable for quantitative researchers accross different fields who have at least some knowledge of regression modelling.\nHow is it solved?\nExamples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields (social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine) and the advantages and disadvantages of the Bayesian model are provided here, and overview of the current and future use of Bayesian statistics.\nThe study mention priors into three categories (informative, weakly informative and diffuse) based on the degree of (un)certainty (hyperparameters) surrounding the population parameter. The prior distribution is as - N( μ0 , σ^ 20) where a larger variance represents a greater amount of uncertainty surrounding.\nPrior elicitation (experts, generic expert, data-based, sample data using maximum likelihood or sample statistics, etc) construct a prior distribution.\nPrior sensitivity analysis of the likelihood helps examine different forms of the model, assesses how the priors and the likelihood align and have an impact on posterior estimates, reflecting variations not captured by the prior or the likelihood alone.\nPrior estimation allows data-informed shrinkage, enacts regularization or influence algorithms towards a likely high-density region, and improves estimation efficiency.\nKnowing the exact probabilistic specification of the priors for a complex model with smaller sample sizes is important. A small sample conveys less information compared to the priors that quantify the strength of support the observed data lends to possible value(s) for the unknown parameter(s).\nFrequentists do not consider the probability of the unknown parameters as useful, and they are considered to be fixed; the likelihood is the conditional probability distribution p(y|θ) of the data (y), given fixed parameters (θ). In Bayesian inference, unknown parameters (random variables) have varied values, while the (observed) data have fixed values, and the likelihood is a function of θ for the fixed data y.\nTherefore, the likelihood function summarizes a statistical model that stochastically generates a range of possible values for θ and the observed data y. With priors and the likelihood of the observed data, the resulting posterior distribution provides an estimate of the unknown parameters, capturing the primary factors and improving our understanding. Monte Carlo technique provides integrals of sampled values from a given distribution through computer simulations. The packages BRMS and Blavaan in R are used for the probabilistic programming language Stan.\nVariable selection after checking correlations among the variables in the model (Eg: gene-to-gene interaction) aids in the prediction of genes in biomedical research (genome-wide association studies).\nSpatial and temporal variability are factored in Bayesian general linear models. A posterior distribution can simulate new data conditional on this distribution, assess, and provide valid predictions to be used for extrapolating to future events.\nResults\nThe Bayesian approach analyzes large-scale cancer genomic data, identifies novel molecular changes in cancer initiation and progression, the interactions between mutated genes and captured mutational signatures, highlighting key genetic interactions components, allowing genomic-based patient stratification both in clinical trials, in the personalized use of therapeutics, and in understanding cancer and its evolutionary processes.\nLimitations:\n\nIn temporal models, posterior inference challenges are inherent in the spatial and/or temporal dependencies (autocorrelation of parameters over time). @VandeSchoot2021\n\n\nBayesian Normal linear regression\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe author provides guidance on Bayesian inference by performing Bayesian Normal linear regression in metrology to calibrate instruments and to evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons in determining fundamental constants.\nWhy is it important?\nThe measurement errors are assumed to be additive, independent, and identically distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance σ2, which is usually unknown.\nRegression is used to calibrate instruments, evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons, or determine fundamental constants, but the regression model cannot be uniquely formulated as a measurement function. Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements are not applicable directly.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: Bayesian inference has the advantage of accounting for additional a priori information, which robustifies the analyses.\nThree steps (prior elicitation, posterior calculation, and robustness to prior uncertainty and model adequacy) and model assumptions are critical to Bayesian inference.\nIn Bayesian inference, all unknowns—observables (data) as well as unobservables (parameters and auxiliary variables) are considered to be random, are assigned probability distributions to summarize the available information, and to update prior knowledge about the unobservables with information about them contained in the data. The prior distribution and likelihood function provided by simple graphical displays, sensitivity analyses, or model checking enhance the elicitation and interpretation process.\nFor Normal linear regression problems\n(1) a family of prior distributions for θ and σ2 is (Normal inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution to a posterior from the same family of (NIG) distributions or\n(2) alternative families of prior distributions (hierarchical priors) assign an additional layer of distributions to uncertain prior parameters or non-para- metric priors.\nThe NIG prior with known variance σ2 of observations is a conjugate prior distribution. Vague or non-informative prior distributions can be derived from the NIG prior.\nBayesian inference is influenced by\n\nthe uncertainty in the transformation of prior knowledge to prior distributions\nthe assumptions of the statistical model\nthe mistakes in data acquisition\n\nResults\nThe knowledge from related previous experiments (Normal inverse Gamma distributions) allow for analytic posterior calculations of many quantities of interest. @Klauenberg2015\n\nBayesian linear regression and priors (exchangeable and unexchangeable)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe study developed a test of a formal method for augmenting data in linear regression analyses, by incorporating both exchangeable and unexchangeable information on regression coefficients (and standard errors) of previous studies.\nWhy is it important?\nThe frequent combination of multiple testing has relatively low statistical power, which is problematic in null-hypothesis significance testing. Linear regression analyses do not account for the published results and summary statistics from similar previous studies. Ignoring information on parameters from previous studies (relevant and readily available), affects the stability and precision of the parameter estimates and results in lower values than they could have been, resulting in conclusions that are less certain and are affected by sampling variation.\nMultiple linear regression with separate significance tests for all regression coefficients, and with the modest sample sizes, different studies find different sets of statistically significant predictors, and addressing the issue on larger samples is practically unrealistic.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: Bayesian linear regression accommodates prior knowledge, overcoming the absence of formal studies, handles the issues of increasing the sample size, and augments the data of a new study with previous results (regression coefficients and standard errors) from similar studies.\nThe authors used Bayesian linear regression to solve the issue of the univariate case analysis by combining evidence of specific predictors from different linear regression analyses (as in meta-analysis) and found it a better method to resolve the issue of simultaneously combining multiple regression parameters per study, which ignored the relationship between the regression coefficients. Includes summary statistics from previous studies, Bayesian linear regression provided a more acceptable solution when data from previous studies were not (realistically) obtainable.\nModels in the study as categorized the model into - (1) Exchangable - when the current data and previous studies have the same set of predictors. (2) Unexchangable – when the predictors were different in the two.\nTo yield the posterior density that reflects the updated knowledge about the model parameters after having observed the data, the steps to Bayesian linear regression steps are mentioned -\n(1) To calculate the probability density function for the data given the unknown model parameters;\n(2) Taken as a function of those model parameters, the likelihood function is the second part of the prior density function of the model parameters. It quantifies what is assumed to be known about the model parameters before observing the data. The study applied the Standard multiple linear regression model, and with the integration of the prior, provided the joint posterior density using the Gibbs sampler. An Ordinary Least Squares linear regression was then applied to each of these samples to obtain the estimated regression coefficients B and the corresponding standard errors.\n(3) A hierarchical model version was developed in analyzing parameters where studies are not exchangeable.\nResults\nIncorporating priors from previous studies in a linear regression on new data yielded a significantly better parameter estimate with an adequate approximation.\nThe gains in comparison to using just the new data, and the large effects were obtained when the data from previous studies were available, resulting in encouraging performance.\nPerformance of the two versions (exchangeable and unexchangeable) of the replication model was consistently superior to using current data alone.\nThe model developed in the article offers the possibility of obtaining significantly better parameter estimates in a linear regression setting without needing to expend a prohibitive amount of time and energy to obtain data from the previous studies.\nHierarchical version (unexchangeable) of the model offers the advantage of being able to address questions about differences between studies and thus allows for explicit testing of the exchangeability assumption.\nLimitations:\n\nAll studies need to have the same set of predictors.\nThe issue of predictor variables that are correlated. @DeLeeuw2012a\n\n\nBayesian logistic regression (Sequential clinical reasoning approach)\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe study aimed to develop models using a longitudinal prospective cohort to predict the risk of incident cardiovascular disease by incorporating demographic features (basic), six metabolic syndrome components (metabolic score), and conventional risk factors (enhanced model). The study participants free of CVD at baseline were followed up over five years, and a Bayesian clinical reasoning model was applied to diagnose new CVD cases.\nWhy is it important?\nEarly diagnosis, prevention, by identifying subjects under the high-risk category for cardiovascular disease (CVD), impacts health interventions.\nLimited availability of molecular information in clinical practice due to being costly and unavailability affects efficient disease diagnosis. To efficiently identify a high-risk population based on the routinely checked biological markers before doing these expensive molecular testsThe requires an alternative approach to analyze data.\nThe Tailored Framingham Risk Score method, for the purpose, is not sufficient because of the differences present in ethnic groups, location, and socio-economic status, as they require the construction of their own models. Heterogeneity (geographic, ethnic group, variations, and different characteristics of social contextual network) often is unobservable and unmeasurable.\nHow is it solved?\nMethods: The study evaluated subjects enrolled in a Keelung Community-based Integrated Screening (KCIS) Program, for mass screening (20–79 years) in the Keelung city of Taiwan, who were followed for 5 years to identify incident cancers and chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease).\nThe study classified the risk of having incident CVD cases or death from CVD by dint of available calculated standardized risk score of the MetS components (fasting glucose, blood pressure, HDL-C, triglyceride and waist circumference) together with conventional risk factors (gender, heredity, smoking, alcohol drinking, family history of parent’s CVD and betel quid and other relevant factors).\nEmulating a clinician’s evaluation process, the Bayesian clinical reasoning approach in a sequential manner was applied and three models were developed. The approach considered the normal distribution of regression coefficients of all predictors, allowing for uncertainty of clinical weights. The credible intervals of predicted risk estimates were obtained by averaging out. In the model, the individual risk is elicited by prior speculation (first impression) that is updated by objective observed data (patient’s history and laboratory findings), the regression coefficients for computing risk score were treated as random variable with a certain statistical distribution (e.g. normal distribution) rather than a fixed value (traditional risk prediction model by frequentist). The updated prior distribution with the likelihood of the current data provided a posterior distribution to predict the risk for a specific disease. The sequential approach included -\n\nThe (basic) basic model developed via logistic regression used prior information constructed on gender, age, age2, and time period.\nThe second (classical) model (metabolic score model: MS model) was based on six MetS components.\nThe third (enhanced model) incorporated information on smoking, drinking, betel-quid, and family history of CVD.\n\nResults\nCompared to the basic model and classical model, the enhanced model had better performance. The proposed models predicted CVD incidence at the individual level by incorporating routine information with a sequential Bayesian clinical reasoning approach. Patients’ background significantly contributes to baseline risk. Even with ecological heterogeneity, the regression model adopts individual characteristics and makes individual risk prediction for the CVD incidence.\nLimitations:\n\nWhether the interactions between age, gender, metabolic score, and other risk factors should be included.\nThe use of an enhanced model should be validated through external validation by applying the proposed models to new subjects not included in the training of the model parameters. @Liu2013"

    "text": "What is BART-Survival?\n\nIt’s a Python software package developed by the CDC.\nThe package is for survival analysis: studying time-to-event data (how long until something happens, or doesn’t happen).\nIt uses a machine learning method called Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART).\n\nHow does it work (in simple terms)? - “Discrete-time” means it splits up time into chunks (for example, weeks, months, etc.). The model checks at each time‐point whether the event has happened yet or not. - BART is “non-parametric”, which means the model doesn’t assume a fixed mathematical form (like linear or exponential) for how risk changes over time. It lets the data itself shape the risk patterns more flexibly. - Because it’s Bayesian, it gives not just a prediction but also measures of uncertainty (how confident the model is) about those predictions.\nWhat makes it useful / better in some cases - Traditional survival analysis (like the Cox model) often assumes certain things (e.g. that hazards are proportional over time). If those assumptions are wrong, the models can be misleading. BART-Survival is more flexible and can perform better when assumptions of older methods fail. - It provides a friendly API, and tools to dive deeper into the model (e.g. inspecting results, uncertainty) when needed.\nWhen / where we might use it - When you have data about when events happen (or don’t happen) and want to model that. For example, time until recovery, time until equipment failure, time until some event in public health etc. - When you suspect that the standard assumptions of simpler survival models may not hold (e.g. that risk doesn’t change proportionally over time). - When you want flexible models that can give you both predictions and uncertainty.\n\nReference\n\nSparapani, R.

Odisio\nBMC Medical Research Methodology volume 23, Article number: 250 (2023)\nThis research article, published in BMC Medical Research Methodology, introduces and evaluates Bayesian parametric survival models for predicting patient outcomes in medical applications. The authors, Paolucci et al., highlight the advantages of Bayesian models, such as their ability to provide uncertainty measures, require less hyperparameter tuning, and offer a natural mechanism for model updating using Bayes’ rule without needing original training data due to privacy concerns. The study compares these Bayesian models against conventional survival prediction methods like Cox Proportional Hazards and Random Survival Forests, demonstrating comparable performance while exhibiting less overfitting. The article details the mathematical background of these models, their implementation, and presents results from experiments on various public medical datasets to support their utility in personalized medicine.\n\nProblem\nSurvival analysis is crucial in medical research for predicting patient outcomes, such as time until death or disease recurrence. Traditional models like Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) and Random Survival Forests (RSF) have limitations, including assumptions about hazard ratios and challenges with interpretability. Bayesian parametric models offer a promising alternative by providing uncertainty measures, requiring less hyperparameter tuning, and allowing for model updates without needing original training data, which is beneficial for privacy concerns.\nA major gap in current predictive models for medical applications is the lack of a measure of uncertainty associated with predictions, which is crucial for physicians making high-stakes clinical decisions, especially when treatments have differing side effect profiles or costs.\nThe study tackles practical and technical challenges inherent in medical machine learning. Medical datasets are often limited in size due to the subclassification of diseases, making models highly prone to overfitting. Many existing machine learning algorithms also require extensive hyperparameter tuning to implement regularization and prevent this overfitting.\n\n\nMethodology\nThe authors introduce Bayesian parametric survival models, which are based on the assumption that survival times follow a specific statistical distribution (e.g., Exponential, Weibull, Lognormal). These models use Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of the chosen distribution, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge and the quantification of uncertainty in predictions.\n\nBayesian Parametric Survival Models (BPS)\n\nImplemented using the PyMC library in Python.\nModels include Exponential and Weibull distributions.\nParameters are estimated using Linear combinations and neural networks to predict the parameters of the distributions.\n\nTraining\n\nPyMC framework\nBayes Rule for updating (posterior as prior)\n\nEvaluation\n\nPublic Datasets: AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), German Breast Cancer Study (GBCS), Veteran lung cancer (Veteran), Worcester Heart Attack Study (WHAS), and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)\nExperiment 1: Comparison of Bayesian models with CoxPH, RSF, and DeepSurv\nExperiment 2: Model updating vs retraining from scratch\nExperiment 3: Impact of dataset size on model performance\nMetrics: Concordance Index (C-index), Integrated Brier Score (IBS)\nComparison with Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forests, and DeepSurv\n\n\n\n\nResults\nThe results demonstrate that Bayesian parametric survival models perform comparably to traditional methods like CoxPH and RSF, with some advantages in terms of reduced overfitting and the ability to provide uncertainty estimates.

occurred primarily for BMI, age, and race coefficients, which showed distinct posterior shifts relative to the priors. In contrast, weaker predictors such as sex displayed overlapping distributions, indicating that inference for those parameters was more influenced by prior uncertainty than by the observed data.
